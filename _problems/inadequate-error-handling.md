## Description

Inadequate error handling occurs when applications fail to properly anticipate, catch, and manage error conditions, leading to unhandled exceptions, application crashes, and poor user experiences. This includes missing error handling code, generic error responses that don't help users or developers, and error handling that doesn't maintain application stability.

## Indicators ⟡

- Frequent application crashes due to unhandled exceptions
- Generic error messages that don't provide useful information
- Error conditions causing entire application or service failures
- Users encountering technical error messages instead of user-friendly explanations
- Error handling code missing from critical application paths

## Symptoms ▲

- **Unhandled Exceptions:** Exceptions causing application crashes or unexpected termination
- **Generic Error Messages:** Non-specific error messages that don't help users understand issues
- **Cascading Failures:** Single errors causing multiple system components to fail
- **Poor Error Recovery:** Applications unable to recover gracefully from error conditions
- **Information Disclosure:** Error messages revealing sensitive system information

## Root Causes ▼

- **Missing Exception Handling:** Critical code paths lacking try-catch blocks or error checking
- **Insufficient Error Categorization:** Not distinguishing between different types of errors
- **Poor Error Propagation:** Errors not properly passed up through application layers
- **Inadequate Error Recovery Logic:** No mechanisms to gracefully handle and recover from errors
- **Generic Error Responses:** Using catch-all error handling that obscures specific issues
- **Lack of Error Handling Standards:** No consistent approach to error handling across the application

## Detection Methods ○

- **Exception Monitoring:** Monitor application logs for unhandled exceptions and error patterns
- **Error Rate Analysis:** Track error rates and types across different application components
- **User Experience Testing:** Test how users experience and recover from error conditions
- **Error Message Review:** Review error messages for clarity and appropriateness
- **Code Review for Error Handling:** Review code for proper exception handling patterns

## Examples

An e-commerce checkout process fails to handle network timeout errors when communicating with the payment processor. When timeouts occur, the application crashes with an unhandled exception, leaving customers unsure whether their payment was processed. Users see a generic "Application Error" message instead of being informed about the payment status and next steps. Another example involves a file upload feature that doesn't validate file size limits before processing. When users upload files that are too large, the application runs out of memory and crashes, affecting all users. Proper error handling would check file size limits upfront and provide clear feedback about size restrictions.
