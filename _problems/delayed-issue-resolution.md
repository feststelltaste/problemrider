## Description

Delayed issue resolution occurs when identified problems remain unfixed for extended periods because no one takes clear responsibility for addressing them. This creates a situation where issues are recognized, documented, and discussed, but never actually resolved, leading to accumulated technical debt, user frustration, and system degradation over time. The delay often stems from unclear ownership, competing priorities, or the assumption that someone else will handle the problem.

## Indicators ⟡

- Issue tracking systems show problems that remain open for months without progress
- The same problems are discussed repeatedly in meetings without resolution
- Users report the same issues multiple times over extended periods
- Problems are escalated through multiple people without clear resolution ownership
- Known issues are worked around rather than fixed

## Symptoms ▲

- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Unresolved issues accumulate and compound into larger problems
- **[Customer Dissatisfaction](customer-dissatisfaction.md):** Users become frustrated with persistent problems that aren't addressed
- **[System Stagnation](system-stagnation.md):** System quality degrades as problems accumulate without resolution
- **[Workaround Culture](workaround-culture.md):** Teams develop elaborate workarounds instead of fixing root causes
- **[User Trust Erosion](user-trust-erosion.md):** Confidence in the system decreases as problems persist
- **[Maintenance Overhead](maintenance-overhead.md):** More effort required to work around unresolved issues

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Lack of Ownership and Accountability](lack-of-ownership-and-accountability.md):** No clear responsibility for maintaining and fixing system issues
- **Competing Priorities:** Issue resolution competes unsuccessfully with new feature development for resources
- **Resource Constraints:** Insufficient time or personnel allocated to maintenance and issue resolution
- **Priority Misalignment:** Issues that affect users aren't prioritized appropriately by the organization
- **Communication Gaps:** Issues are identified but not effectively communicated to those who can resolve them
- **Risk Aversion:** Fear that fixing issues might introduce new problems, leading to inaction

## Detection Methods ○

- **Issue Age Analysis:** Track how long problems remain in different states without resolution
- **Resolution Time Trends:** Monitor whether issue resolution times are increasing over time
- **Escalation Pattern Analysis:** Track how often issues are transferred between people without resolution
- **User Complaint Tracking:** Monitor recurring complaints about the same unresolved problems
- **Workaround Documentation:** Identify areas where teams document workarounds instead of fixes
- **Meeting Minutes Analysis:** Look for repeated discussions of the same unresolved issues

## Examples

A web application has a known memory leak that causes periodic crashes, requiring daily server restarts. The issue is documented, assigned to various developers over months, but never actually investigated or fixed because everyone assumes someone else with "more expertise" should handle it. Users experience regular service interruptions while the development team focuses on new features. Another example involves a customer service system where search functionality is slow and unreliable, forcing support agents to use complex workarounds to find customer records. The problem is escalated through multiple teams and departments, but no one takes ownership of fixing the underlying database performance issue, leaving customer service efficiency permanently impaired.
