## Description

Dependency version conflicts occur when applications or their dependencies require different versions of the same library, creating incompatibilities that can cause build failures, runtime errors, or unexpected behavior. These conflicts are particularly common in complex applications with many dependencies or when upgrading libraries without considering transitive dependency impacts.

## Indicators ⟡

- Build processes fail due to conflicting dependency requirements
- Runtime errors related to missing methods or incompatible interfaces
- Applications behave differently with seemingly identical dependency lists
- Package managers report version resolution conflicts
- Different behavior between development and production due to dependency variations

## Symptoms ▲

- **Build Failures:** Dependency resolution fails during build or deployment processes
- **Runtime Compatibility Errors:** Methods or classes not found due to version mismatches
- **Transitive Dependency Conflicts:** Indirect dependencies requiring incompatible versions
- **Dependency Resolution Inconsistencies:** Different environments resolving to different dependency versions
- **Breaking Changes from Updates:** Dependency updates introducing incompatible changes

## Root Causes ▼

- **Loose Version Constraints:** Dependencies specified with overly broad version ranges
- **Transitive Dependency Conflicts:** Multiple dependencies requiring incompatible versions of common libraries
- **Inadequate Dependency Locking:** No lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions
- **Dependency Update Without Testing:** Updating dependencies without verifying compatibility
- **Multiple Dependency Sources:** Different package sources providing different versions of same dependency
- **Legacy Dependency Requirements:** Older dependencies constraining newer version adoption

## Detection Methods ○

- **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependency trees for version conflicts
- **Build Reproducibility Testing:** Test builds across different environments for consistency
- **Dependency Version Analysis:** Analyze dependency version constraints and conflicts
- **Compatibility Testing:** Test application functionality after dependency updates
- **Lock File Validation:** Ensure lock files accurately represent dependency state

## Examples

A Node.js application depends on Library A version 2.x and Library B version 3.x, but Library B has a transitive dependency on Library A version 1.x. The package manager resolves this by installing Library A version 1.x, causing the application's direct usage of Library A to fail because it expects version 2.x APIs that don't exist in version 1.x. This causes runtime errors that are difficult to debug because the dependency conflict isn't obvious. Another example involves a Java application where two different libraries include different versions of the Apache Commons library. Maven resolves this by choosing one version, but the application code and one of the libraries expect different method signatures, leading to NoSuchMethodError exceptions at runtime that only occur with specific code paths.
