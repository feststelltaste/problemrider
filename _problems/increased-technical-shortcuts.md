## Description

Increased technical shortcuts occurs when development teams consistently choose quick, expedient solutions over proper, well-designed implementations due to delivery pressure or time constraints. These shortcuts may solve immediate problems but create technical debt, reduce code quality, and make future development more difficult. The pattern represents a shift from sustainable development practices toward unsustainable quick fixes.

## Indicators ⟡

- Developers frequently mention "doing it the quick way" or "just to get it working"
- Code reviews reveal more quick fixes and workarounds than usual
- Technical debt items are created but immediately deprioritized
- Solutions are implemented without proper design consideration
- Team discussions focus on "getting it done" rather than "getting it right"

## Symptoms ▲

- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Accumulation of shortcuts creates maintenance burden for future development
- **[Accumulation of Workarounds](accumulation-of-workarounds.md):** Quick fixes layer on top of each other, creating complex system behavior
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** Shortcuts often involve fragile implementations that break easily
- **[Increased Bug Count](increased-bug-count.md):** Quick fixes are more likely to introduce defects
- **Code Quality Degradation:** Overall codebase quality decreases as shortcuts accumulate

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Aggressive deadlines force teams to prioritize speed over quality
- **Deadline-Driven Culture:** Organizational culture that rewards meeting deadlines over sustainable practices
- **[Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md):** Review processes don't catch or discourage shortcuts
- **Lack of Refactoring Time:** No time allocated to improve quick fixes into proper solutions
- **Performance Pressure:** Individual or team pressure to demonstrate rapid progress
- **Insufficient Technical Leadership:** Lack of guidance on when shortcuts are acceptable vs. when proper solutions are needed

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Review Analysis:** Monitor comments and patterns indicating shortcuts in code reviews
- **Technical Debt Tracking:** Track rate of technical debt creation vs. resolution
- **Code Quality Metrics:** Monitor complexity and maintainability metrics over time
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about pressure to take shortcuts
- **Sprint Planning Analysis:** Track ratio of "quick fixes" vs. "proper solutions" in sprint planning

## Examples

A development team working on an e-commerce platform consistently chooses quick database query fixes over proper indexing strategies because indexing changes require more testing and coordination. Over 6 months, they've added dozens of one-off query optimizations that make the database schema increasingly complex and difficult to maintain. Another example involves a team that repeatedly adds conditional logic and special cases to existing functions rather than refactoring them properly, because refactoring takes more time upfront. A single user registration function has grown to 800 lines with nested conditionals handling dozens of special cases that could have been handled through proper object-oriented design.
