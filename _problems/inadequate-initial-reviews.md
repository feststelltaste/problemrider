## Description

Inadequate initial reviews occur when the first round of code review fails to identify important issues, design problems, or potential improvements that should have been caught early. This results in multiple review cycles where new issues are discovered in each round, extending the review process unnecessarily and creating frustration for both authors and reviewers. The problem indicates that reviewers are not conducting thorough analysis during their initial examination of the code.

## Indicators ⟡

- Issues that should have been obvious are only identified in later review rounds
- Each review round reveals completely new categories of problems
- Reviewers provide only superficial feedback initially, then deeper analysis in subsequent rounds
- Important design or architectural issues are missed until after implementation details are reviewed
- Review quality improves significantly in later rounds compared to initial reviews

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Extended Review Cycles](extended-review-cycles.md):** Multiple rounds are needed because initial reviews don't catch all issues
- **[Implementation Rework](implementation-rework.md):** Authors must make significant changes late in the review process
- **Team loses confidence that reviews will catch issues early**
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Poor initial reviews create delays and inefficiencies
- **Reviewers' effectiveness is questioned when they miss obvious problems**

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Reviewer Inexperience](reviewer-inexperience.md):** Reviewers lack skills to conduct comprehensive analysis in first pass
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Reviewers rush through initial reviews due to competing priorities
- **No systematic approach to ensure comprehensive coverage**
- **Large or complex changes exceed reviewers' ability to analyze thoroughly**
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Reviewers don't allocate adequate time for thorough initial analysis

## Detection Methods ○

- **Issue Discovery Pattern Analysis:** Track when different types of issues are identified across review rounds
- **First-Round Effectiveness Measurement:** Assess what percentage of total issues are caught in initial reviews
- **Review Quality Progression:** Analyze whether review feedback gets significantly deeper in later rounds
- **Reviewer Performance Assessment:** Compare different reviewers' ability to identify issues early
- **Time Investment Correlation:** Examine relationship between time spent on initial review and issue discovery

## Examples

A developer submits a complex feature implementation and receives initial review feedback focused entirely on code formatting and variable naming. Only in the third review round does a reviewer notice that the algorithm has O(n²) complexity and could be optimized, and in the fourth round someone identifies that the error handling could cause data corruption. The issues that required the most significant rework should have been caught immediately but were missed because the initial reviewer only looked at surface-level style issues. Another example involves a security-sensitive authentication feature where the first reviewer approves the implementation after checking only the happy path logic. In the second round, a different reviewer identifies that the error handling reveals sensitive information, and in the third round someone discovers that the session management has a race condition vulnerability. These critical security issues should have been the primary focus of the initial review but were missed due to superficial analysis.
