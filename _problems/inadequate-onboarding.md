## Description
Inadequate onboarding is the failure to provide new users with the guidance and support they need to be successful with an application. This can be a result of a lack of a clear and concise introduction to the application, a failure to provide a guided tour of the key features, or a lack of a clear and accessible help system. A poor onboarding experience can lead to a high rate of user abandonment, as users who are unable to figure out how to use the application will quickly become frustrated and give up.

## Indicators ⟡
- A high percentage of new users are abandoning the application after a short period of time.
- The support team is receiving a high volume of questions from new users.
- New users are not using the key features of the application.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Negative User Feedback](negative-user-feedback.md): New users complain that the application is difficult to learn and use.
- [Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md): The application has a high churn rate and a low user adoption rate.
- **Low User Engagement:** New users are not actively using the application or exploring its features.

## Root Causes ▼
- **Lack of a User-Centered Design Process:** The onboarding process was not designed with the needs of new users in mind.
- **No Guided Tour:** The application does not provide a guided tour or a tutorial to help new users get started.
- **Information Decay:** The application's documentation is not clear, concise, or easy to find.

## Detection Methods ○
- **User Testing:** Observe new users as they go through the onboarding process to identify areas of confusion and frustration.
- **User Surveys:** Collect feedback from new users about their onboarding experience.
- **Analytics:** Track user behavior during the onboarding process to identify where users are dropping off.

## Examples
A company launches a new social media application. However, the application does not have a clear and concise onboarding process. As a result, many new users are confused about how to use the application and quickly abandon it. The company has to invest in a complete redesign of the onboarding process to improve the user experience and reduce the churn rate.
