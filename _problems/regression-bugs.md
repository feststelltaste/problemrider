## Description

Regression bugs are defects that occur when previously working functionality breaks due to new code changes, feature additions, or bug fixes. These bugs represent a significant threat to software quality because they erode user trust and can reintroduce problems that were thought to be resolved. Regression bugs are particularly problematic because they often go undetected until users encounter them in production, and they indicate fundamental issues with testing practices and code maintainability.

## Indicators ⟡
- Users report that features that used to work are now broken
- Previously passing tests start failing after new deployments
- Customer support receives complaints about functionality that worked in previous versions
- Quality assurance frequently discovers that fixing one bug introduces another
- The team regularly discusses whether changes might "break something else"

## Symptoms ▲
- **[User Trust Erosion](user-trust-erosion.md):** End users report that functionality they rely on has stopped working
- **[Frequent Hotfixes and Rollbacks](frequent-hotfixes-and-rollbacks.md):** Frequent emergency deployments to fix broken functionality
- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** The overall number of bugs found in production increases
- **Lost User Confidence:** Users become hesitant to adopt new versions or features
- **[Release Anxiety](release-anxiety.md):** The team becomes nervous about deployments due to the risk of breaking existing functionality

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** Inadequate test coverage fails to catch regressions before deployment
- **[Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md):** Manual testing cannot efficiently verify that all existing functionality still works
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** Fragile code architecture makes it easy for changes to have unintended side effects
- **Poor Understanding of Dependencies:** Developers don't fully understand how their changes might affect other parts of the system
- **Inadequate Change Impact Analysis:** No systematic process for evaluating the potential effects of code changes
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Rushed development and testing cycles skip thorough regression verification

## Detection Methods ○
- **Automated Regression Test Suites:** Comprehensive automated tests that verify existing functionality after every change
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Systematic testing of key user workflows before releases
- **Production Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of system behavior to catch regressions quickly
- **A/B Testing:** Gradual rollouts that can detect regressions before full deployment
- **Bug Categorization:** Track and categorize bugs to identify patterns of regression issues

## Examples

A team adds a new feature to their shopping cart that allows users to save items for later. During implementation, they modify the cart persistence logic to support the new functionality. After deployment, users discover that their cart contents are no longer preserved when they log out and log back in—a core feature that had worked perfectly for years. The regression occurred because the new "save for later" feature changed the data structure used to store cart items, but the existing cart loading logic wasn't updated to handle the new format. The automated tests didn't catch this because they only tested the happy path of the new feature, not the existing cart functionality. Another example involves a banking application where a security patch to prevent SQL injection inadvertently breaks the transaction history display for accounts with certain special characters in their names, causing customer service to be flooded with calls from users who can't access their transaction history.
