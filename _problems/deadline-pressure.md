## Description

Deadline pressure occurs when development teams face intense time constraints that force them to prioritize speed over quality, leading to rushed implementations, skipped best practices, and accumulation of technical debt. While some deadline pressure can motivate teams, excessive pressure consistently leads to poor decision-making, increased stress, and long-term problems that ultimately slow development more than the original time savings provided.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team consistently works overtime to meet deadlines
- Code reviews are shortened or skipped to save time
- Testing phases are compressed or eliminated
- Design and planning activities are rushed or bypassed
- Team expresses anxiety about meeting unrealistic timelines

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Increased Technical Shortcuts](increased-technical-shortcuts.md):** Quality practices are abandoned to save time
- **[Rapid Prototyping Becoming Production](rapid-prototyping-becoming-production.md):** Quick implementations become permanent solutions
- **[Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md):** Code quality suffers under time pressure
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team becomes exhausted and demoralized
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Shortcuts taken under pressure create long-term maintenance burden

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Unrealistic Schedule](unrealistic-schedule.md):** Timelines don't account for proper development practices
- **External Business Pressure:** Market competition or customer demands drive aggressive deadlines
- **[Poor Planning](poor-planning.md):** Inadequate estimation and planning create artificial time constraints
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** Additional requirements are added without adjusting timelines
- **Organizational Culture:** Culture that rewards speed over sustainability

## Detection Methods ○

- **Overtime Hours Tracking:** Monitor team working hours and stress indicators
- **Quality Metrics Correlation:** Compare code quality metrics with deadline periods
- **Technical Debt Accumulation:** Track when technical debt increases relative to deadline pressure
- **Team Stress Surveys:** Regular assessment of team stress levels and deadline concerns
- **Decision Quality Analysis:** Evaluate quality of technical decisions made under time pressure

## Examples

A development team is given four weeks to implement a complex payment processing feature that would normally take eight weeks to do properly. Under intense deadline pressure, they skip writing unit tests, implement quick-and-dirty error handling, and use a simple but inefficient database design. The feature ships on time but immediately starts causing performance problems in production. Fixing the performance issues requires three weeks of additional work and introduces bugs because the code wasn't properly tested. The "time savings" from rushing actually cost more time in the long run and damaged the team's credibility. Another example involves a team facing a critical business deadline who decides to copy and modify an existing code module rather than designing a proper abstraction. The copied code works for the immediate need but creates maintenance overhead as both modules must be updated for future changes. Six months later, the team has spent more time maintaining the duplicated code than they would have spent implementing a proper solution initially.
