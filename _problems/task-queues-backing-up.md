## Description
Task queues are essential for asynchronous processing, but they can become a bottleneck if tasks are produced faster than they are consumed. When a task queue backs up, it means the queue is growing faster than workers can process the tasks within it. This can lead to significant delays in processing, increased memory usage for the queue itself, and potentially, data loss if the queue has a size limit. A backed-up queue is a strong indicator that the processing capacity of the system is insufficient for its current workload.

## Indicators ⟡
- The number of messages in your queue is growing.
- The time it takes to process a message is increasing.
- Your workers are constantly running at high CPU or memory usage.
- You are getting alerts from your monitoring system about the queue size.

## Symptoms ▲

- **Increased Queue Size:** Monitoring shows a continuous increase in the number of pending messages or tasks in a queue.
- **Delayed Processing:** Jobs that should be processed quickly are taking an unusually long time to complete.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Workers processing the queue may consume excessive CPU, memory, or network resources.
- **Application Unresponsiveness:** Features relying on asynchronous processing become slow or appear broken.
- **Missed SLAs:** Service Level Agreements for background tasks are violated.
- **Data Staleness:** Data that relies on asynchronous updates becomes outdated.

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Insufficient Worker Capacity](insufficient-worker-capacity.md):** Not enough workers (consumers) are available to process the incoming rate of tasks.
- **[Inefficient Code](inefficient-code.md):** Individual workers are taking too long to process each task, often due to inefficient code, external service delays, or database bottlenecks.
- **Spiky Workload:** Sudden, large influxes of tasks overwhelm the processing capacity.
- **Poison Messages:** Malformed or erroneous messages in the queue cause workers to fail repeatedly or get stuck.
- **[Network Latency](network-latency.md):** Delays in communication between producers/consumers and the message queue.
- **Queue System Bottlenecks:** The message queue itself (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, SQS) becomes a bottleneck due to misconfiguration or insufficient resources.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Queue Monitoring Tools:** Use built-in monitoring dashboards or APIs of the message queue system to track queue size, message rates, and consumer lag.
- **Worker Metrics:** Monitor CPU, memory, and process counts of worker instances.
- **Application Logging:** Log the start and end times of individual tasks to identify slow processing.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Trace asynchronous workflows to pinpoint bottlenecks within the task processing.
- **Alerting:** Set up alerts for when queue sizes exceed a certain threshold or processing latency increases.

## Examples
An e-commerce platform uses a message queue for processing order confirmations and sending emails. During a flash sale, the number of orders spikes, and the email queue starts backing up, leading to delayed order confirmations and a poor customer experience. In another case, a data analytics pipeline uses a task queue to process incoming data files. One of the processing steps involves a complex, unoptimized database query. As the volume of data increases, this slow step causes the queue to grow continuously, leading to significant delays in data availability. This problem is common in event-driven architectures and microservices where asynchronous communication is heavily used. It highlights the importance of proper capacity planning, efficient worker implementation, and robust monitoring for message queue systems.
