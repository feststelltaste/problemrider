## Description
A procedural background can be a major obstacle to writing good object-oriented code. Developers who are used to thinking in a procedural way may struggle to adapt to an object-oriented way of thinking. This can lead to the creation of procedural-style code in an object-oriented language, which can be difficult to maintain and evolve. A procedural background is a common problem in the software industry, and it can be difficult to address.

## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is full of static methods.
- The codebase is full of utility classes.
- The codebase is not using inheritance or polymorphism.
- The codebase is difficult to understand and maintain.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Procedural Programming in OOP Languages](procedural-programming-in-oop-languages.md):** The codebase is written in a procedural style, even though it is an object-oriented language.
- **[Misunderstanding of OOP](misunderstanding-of-oop.md):** The team does not have a good understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming.
- **[Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md):** The team lacks the necessary skills and experience to design and build well-structured, maintainable software.
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** The codebase is full of technical debt, which is making it more and more difficult to maintain.

## Root Causes ▼
- **Lack of Training:** The team has not been properly trained in object-oriented design principles and patterns.
- **Lack of Experience:** The team does not have enough experience to be able to think in an object-oriented way.
- **Slow Knowledge Transfer:** There is no one on the team who can mentor the other developers and help them to improve their object-oriented design skills.
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** The team is under pressure to deliver features quickly, and they do not have time to focus on good design.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify procedural-style code.
- **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify code that is not following object-oriented design principles.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their confidence in their object-oriented design skills.
- **Architectural Assessments:** Conduct an assessment of the system's architecture to identify design flaws.

## Examples
A company hires a team of developers who have a background in procedural programming. The team is tasked with building a new web application in an object-oriented language. The team struggles to adapt to an object-oriented way of thinking, and they create a system that is poorly designed and difficult to maintain. The company eventually has to hire a team of experienced object-oriented developers to rewrite the entire system.
