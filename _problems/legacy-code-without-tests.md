## Description

Legacy code without tests refers to existing production systems that were built before comprehensive testing practices were adopted or where testing was deprioritized during development. This code is particularly challenging because it's often tightly coupled, has hidden dependencies, and lacks the design characteristics that make testing straightforward. Adding tests to legacy code requires significant effort and expertise, creating a barrier that prevents teams from improving code quality and reducing technical debt.

## Indicators ⟡
- Large portions of critical production code have no associated automated tests
- Code was written before the team adopted test-driven development or testing best practices
- Attempts to add tests to existing code require extensive refactoring
- Developers avoid modifying certain areas due to lack of test coverage
- Production systems have been running for years without comprehensive test suites

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Developers are reluctant to modify untested legacy code due to risk of breaking functionality
- **[Difficult to Test Code](difficult-to-test-code.md):** Legacy code architecture makes it challenging to write effective tests
- **[Poor Test Coverage](poor-test-coverage.md):** Critical system functionality lacks test coverage
- **[Maintenance Paralysis](maintenance-paralysis.md):** Teams avoid necessary improvements because they cannot verify that changes don't break existing functionality
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Untested code becomes increasingly difficult to maintain and improve over time

## Root Causes ▼
- **Historical Development Practices:** Code was written when testing practices were less mature or prioritized
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Legacy code often has high coupling that makes unit testing extremely difficult
- **[Hidden Dependencies](hidden-dependencies.md):** Code directly depends on databases, file systems, or external services without abstraction layers
- **[Global State and Side Effects](global-state-and-side-effects.md):** Heavy reliance on static methods and global state that cannot be easily mocked
- **[Complex Implementation Paths](complex-implementation-paths.md):** Legacy objects require complex initialization that's difficult to replicate in tests
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Pressure to maintain existing functionality leaves little time for adding retrospective tests

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Coverage Analysis:** Measure test coverage for different parts of the system to identify untested legacy areas
- **Code Age Analysis:** Identify older code sections that were written before testing practices were established
- **Dependency Analysis:** Map code dependencies to identify areas that would be difficult to test
- **Change Frequency vs. Test Coverage:** Correlate how often code is modified with its test coverage
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members which areas of code they're most afraid to modify due to lack of tests

## Examples

A 10-year-old inventory management system processes millions of dollars in transactions daily but has zero automated tests. The core inventory tracking algorithms, pricing calculations, and order fulfillment logic are all untested legacy code written by developers who have since left the company. When the business needs to add support for new product categories, developers discover that the existing code uses global variables, directly queries databases within business logic methods, and has circular dependencies between classes. Adding tests would require extensive refactoring that could break existing functionality, but modifying the code without tests is extremely risky given the financial impact of bugs. The team is trapped in a situation where they cannot safely improve the code without tests, but cannot add tests without potentially breaking the existing system. Another example involves a customer relationship management system where the lead scoring algorithms are implemented in a 3,000-line class that directly accesses external APIs, modifies database records, and sends emails. The complexity and tight coupling make it virtually impossible to create unit tests, while the lack of tests makes it dangerous to refactor the code into more testable components.
