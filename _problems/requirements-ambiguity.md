## Description

Requirements ambiguity occurs when system requirements are expressed in ways that allow for multiple interpretations, lack sufficient detail for implementation, or fail to address critical edge cases and constraints. This ambiguity forces developers to make assumptions about intended functionality, often leading to implementations that don't match stakeholder expectations. The problem is compounded when ambiguous requirements aren't clarified early in the development process, resulting in costly rework when the misalignment is discovered.

## Indicators ⟡

- Developers frequently ask for clarification about requirements during implementation
- Different team members interpret the same requirement in conflicting ways
- Requirements use vague language like "user-friendly" or "fast" without specific criteria
- Edge cases and error conditions are not addressed in requirements
- Stakeholders express surprise or dissatisfaction with implemented functionality that technically meets written requirements

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** Implemented features don't match stakeholder expectations
- **[Implementation Rework](implementation-rework.md):** Code must be significantly modified after requirements clarification
- **[Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md):** Persistent misunderstandings between business and technical teams
- **[Assumption-Based Development](assumption-based-development.md):** Developers make incorrect assumptions about intended functionality
- **[Extended Cycle Times](extended-cycle-times.md):** Development is slowed by need for constant requirement clarification
- **[User Frustration](user-frustration.md):** End users find that system doesn't support their actual workflows

## Root Causes ▼

- **Incomplete Requirements Gathering:** Requirements collection doesn't explore edge cases or detailed scenarios
- **Communication Skill Gaps:** Stakeholders struggle to articulate their needs clearly
- **Domain Knowledge Limitations:** Requirements writers don't fully understand the business domain
- **Assumption-Heavy Documentation:** Requirements assume shared context that doesn't exist
- **Review Process Weaknesses:** Requirements aren't reviewed thoroughly by both business and technical stakeholders
- **Template Limitations:** Requirements templates don't prompt for necessary detail
- **Time Pressure:** Requirements gathering is rushed due to project timeline pressure

## Detection Methods ○

- **Clarification Request Tracking:** Monitor how often developers ask for requirement clarifications
- **Implementation Variance Analysis:** Compare delivered functionality with original requirements
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Assessment:** Evaluate whether deliverables meet stakeholder expectations
- **Requirements Review Effectiveness:** Assess quality of requirements review processes
- **Rework Metrics:** Track how much development work is redone due to requirement issues
- **User Acceptance Testing Results:** Analyze whether implementations pass user acceptance criteria

## Examples

A requirement states "The system should provide fast search functionality," but doesn't specify what "fast" means or under what conditions. One developer implements a search that returns results in 100ms for simple queries, while another assumes "fast" means comprehensive search including full-text indexing that takes 2 seconds but finds more relevant results. When stakeholders test the system, they discover that their definition of "fast" was sub-second response time for any query, requiring significant rework of the search implementation. Another example involves a requirement for "user-friendly data entry forms" without specifying what makes forms user-friendly. The development team creates forms that are technically functional but don't support the keyboard shortcuts, validation patterns, and workflow shortcuts that users expect based on their current tools, resulting in user rejection of the new system despite meeting the written requirements.
