## Description

Inconsistent quality occurs when different parts of a software system exhibit dramatically different levels of quality, maintenance, and reliability. This creates a patchwork effect where some components are robust and well-designed while others are fragile, poorly documented, or difficult to maintain. This inconsistency often emerges when there's no systematic approach to quality standards or when different teams or individuals take varying levels of care with their work.

## Indicators ⟡

- Some system modules are reliable while others frequently break
- Code quality varies dramatically between different parts of the codebase
- User experience differs significantly across different features
- Some areas have comprehensive tests while others have none
- Documentation quality varies widely across different components

## Symptoms ▲

- **[User Confusion](user-confusion.md):** Users struggle with inconsistent interfaces and behaviors across different parts of the system
- **[Maintenance Bottlenecks](maintenance-bottlenecks.md):** Certain parts of the system become difficult to maintain or modify
- **[Unpredictable System Behavior](unpredictable-system-behavior.md):** Different components behave in unexpected ways due to varying quality standards
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Developers become frustrated working with poorly maintained legacy code
- **Training Overhead:** New team members struggle to understand systems with inconsistent patterns

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Lack of Ownership and Accountability](lack-of-ownership-and-accountability.md):** No clear ownership of quality standards across the system
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Some areas accumulate more technical debt than others due to different maintenance priorities
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** Different coding standards and practices applied across different areas
- **Team Turnover:** Different developers or teams working on different areas with varying quality standards
- **Historical Context:** Legacy components built with different tools, constraints, or quality expectations
- **Priority Misalignment:** Business priorities focus quality efforts on some areas while neglecting others

## Detection Methods ○

- **Quality Metric Analysis:** Compare code quality metrics (complexity, test coverage, bug rates) across different system components
- **User Feedback Analysis:** Track user complaints and satisfaction scores for different features
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about their experience working with different parts of the system
- **Code Review Patterns:** Analyze the types and frequency of issues found in reviews for different areas
- **Maintenance Effort Tracking:** Monitor how much time is spent maintaining different system components

## Examples

A financial application has a modern, well-tested payment processing module with comprehensive error handling and logging, while the account management system is a poorly documented legacy component with minimal tests and frequent bugs. Users experience smooth payment flows but constantly encounter issues when updating their profile information. Another example involves an e-commerce platform where the product catalog search is fast and reliable, but the shopping cart frequently loses items and has confusing behavior, leading to customer complaints and abandoned purchases.
