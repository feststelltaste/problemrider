## Description
Frequent changes to requirements occur when the project's scope and specifications are in a constant state of flux, even after development is underway. This is more than just agile adaptation; it's a sign of instability in the project's foundation. When requirements are not well-defined or agreed upon upfront, teams are forced to constantly pivot, leading to wasted work, missed deadlines, and a decline in team morale. This problem often points to deeper issues in communication, planning, and stakeholder alignment.

## Indicators ⟡
- The project's scope is constantly expanding.
- The team is frequently missing deadlines.
- The team is constantly context-switching.
- There is a lot of rework.

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Implementation Rework](implementation-rework.md):** Developers frequently have to discard or significantly modify already completed work.
- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Project timelines are extended due to continuous adjustments to the scope.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Teams become demotivated by the constant shifting of goals and wasted effort.
- **[Increased Cost of Development](increased-cost-of-development.md):** More time and resources are spent on changes rather than new development.
- **[Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md):** Rushed changes or patches introduced to accommodate new requirements can lead to bugs.
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** This problem often goes hand-in-hand with scope creep, where new features are added without proper planning.

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** Initial requirements were ambiguous, incomplete, or not thoroughly vetted.
- **[Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md):** Key stakeholders were not involved early or consistently enough in the requirements gathering process.
- **[Competing Priorities](competing-priorities.md):** External market forces or internal strategic shifts necessitate changes mid-project.
- [Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md): Misunderstandings between business, product, and development teams about what is being built.
- [Change Management Chaos](change-management-chaos.md): No clear process for evaluating, approving, and integrating changes to requirements.
- **[Unrealistic Deadlines](unrealistic-deadlines.md):** Commitments were made to deliver features without a full understanding of their complexity or dependencies.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Version Control System Analysis:** Track changes to requirements documents or user stories in your project management tool.
- **Project Management Metrics:** Monitor changes in project scope, estimated vs. actual completion times, and number of re-opened tasks.
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss recurring issues related to changing requirements and their impact on the team.
- **Stakeholder Interviews:** Ask stakeholders about their confidence in the current requirements and their understanding of the development process.

## Examples
A mobile app development team is halfway through building a new user profile screen when the marketing department decides they need a completely different layout and additional fields to support a new campaign. The developers have to scrap much of their work and start over. Similarly, during the development of an API, the data model is constantly being revised by the product owner based on new insights from user research, forcing frequent database schema migrations and code refactoring. This problem is a classic challenge in software development, often stemming from a disconnect between business strategy and execution. While some changes are inevitable, frequent, unplanned changes can cripple a project's progress and team morale.
