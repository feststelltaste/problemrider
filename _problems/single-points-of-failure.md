## Description

Single points of failure occur when critical system knowledge, capabilities, or processes depend entirely on individual team members or specific system components. When these individuals are unavailable or when key components fail, entire projects can be blocked, critical issues cannot be resolved, and development progress stops. This creates significant organizational risk and reduces team resilience, making the organization vulnerable to disruption from personnel changes or system failures.

## Indicators ⟡

- Specific team members are essential for certain types of work
- Development stops when key individuals are unavailable
- Critical system components have no backup or redundancy
- Certain problems can only be solved by one person
- Team panics when key personnel are sick or on vacation

## Symptoms ▲

- **Development Bottlenecks:** Work cannot proceed when key individuals are unavailable
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical information is concentrated in specific individuals
- **Crisis Management:** Team scrambles to find alternatives when key people or systems are unavailable
- **Reduced Team Flexibility:** Cannot reassign work because only certain people can do specific tasks
- **Organizational Risk:** High vulnerability to personnel changes or system failures

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical expertise isn't shared among team members
- **Insufficient Cross-Training:** Team members aren't trained on each other's specializations
- **Information Decay:** Critical processes and knowledge aren't recorded for others to use
- **Specialization Without Redundancy:** Team structure creates specialists without backup coverage
- **System Architecture Issues:** Technical architecture creates dependencies on specific components
- **Time Pressure:** No time allocated for knowledge transfer or building redundancy

## Detection Methods ○

- **Bus Factor Analysis:** Identify what would happen if key individuals were unavailable
- **Dependency Mapping:** Chart which work depends on specific people or systems
- **Knowledge Distribution Assessment:** Evaluate how evenly critical knowledge is distributed
- **Availability Impact Tracking:** Monitor how often individual unavailability blocks work
- **Cross-Training Audit:** Assess how many people can perform critical tasks

## Examples

The entire deployment process depends on one senior developer who knows the complex sequence of manual steps, server configurations, and troubleshooting procedures. When they're sick for a week, releases are completely blocked because nobody else understands how to safely deploy the application or fix deployment issues. The team discovers they have no documentation of the deployment process and that attempts by others to deploy result in system failures. Another example involves a legacy database system where only one team member understands the complex data migration scripts and performance tuning procedures. When they leave the company, the team faces a crisis because critical database maintenance tasks can no longer be performed, and new features requiring database changes are blocked indefinitely.
