## Description

Procrastination on complex tasks occurs when developers consistently delay or avoid starting difficult, cognitively demanding, or uncertain work in favor of easier, more immediately satisfying activities. This behavior often stems from psychological factors such as fear of failure, perfectionism, or cognitive overload. While some level of task preference is natural, systematic procrastination on complex work can lead to accumulation of difficult problems and increased technical debt.

## Indicators ⟡

- Difficult tasks remain unstarted while easier tasks are completed quickly
- Team members find reasons to work on other activities when assigned complex problems
- Complex features consistently slip to later sprints or iterations
- Developers express anxiety or stress when discussing challenging work
- Simple bugs get fixed immediately while complex issues remain in the backlog

## Symptoms ▲

- **Backlog of Complex Work:** Difficult tasks accumulate while simple ones are completed
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Complex refactoring tasks are avoided, allowing debt to grow
- **Last-Minute Crisis Management:** Delayed complex work becomes urgent and must be rushed
- **[Skill Development Gaps](skill-development-gaps.md):** Team doesn't develop capabilities by avoiding challenging problems
- **[Quality Compromises](quality-compromises.md):** Complex work done under time pressure suffers from poor quality

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Fear of Failure](fear-of-failure.md):** Concern about not being able to solve complex problems successfully
- **Perfectionist Tendencies:** Desire to do complex work perfectly creates paralysis
- **[Mental Fatigue](mental-fatigue.md):** Insufficient cognitive energy to tackle demanding problems
- **Unclear Requirements:** Ambiguity about complex tasks makes them harder to start
- **Imposter Syndrome:** Self-doubt about ability to handle sophisticated technical challenges

## Detection Methods ○

- **Task Start Delay Analysis:** Measure time between task assignment and when work actually begins
- **Complexity vs Completion Time:** Compare task complexity ratings with actual completion patterns
- **Backlog Age by Complexity:** Track how long complex versus simple tasks remain in the backlog
- **Developer Feedback Surveys:** Ask about factors that influence task selection and avoidance
- **Sprint Planning Behavior:** Observe which tasks are volunteered for versus avoided during planning

## Examples

A development team has three architectural refactoring tasks in their backlog that have been there for four months, while dozens of smaller feature additions and bug fixes have been completed during the same period. Team members consistently volunteer for the smaller tasks during sprint planning and find reasons why the refactoring work "isn't quite ready" or "needs more analysis." The avoided refactoring becomes increasingly urgent as the system becomes harder to maintain, but by the time it must be addressed, the work has become even more complex and risky due to changes made around the problematic areas. Another example involves a developer who needs to implement a complex algorithm for data processing but keeps finding other tasks to work on first - updating documentation, fixing minor UI issues, optimizing database queries. The algorithm implementation remains untouched for weeks while the developer stays busy with less challenging work, eventually causing the feature to miss its deadline and requiring emergency weekend work to complete.
