## Description

Logging configuration issues occur when applications have improperly configured logging systems that either capture too little information for effective debugging, generate excessive log volume that overwhelms storage and analysis systems, or inadvertently log sensitive information creating security vulnerabilities. Poor logging configuration makes troubleshooting difficult and can impact system performance.

## Indicators ⟡

- Critical system events not appearing in logs
- Log files growing uncontrollably or consuming excessive storage
- Sensitive information like passwords or personal data appearing in logs
- Inconsistent log formats across different application components
- Performance issues related to excessive logging operations

## Symptoms ▲

- **Missing Critical Log Information:** Important system events or errors not logged
- **Log Volume Overflow:** Excessive logging consuming storage and processing resources
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Personal information, credentials, or secrets logged in plain text
- **Inconsistent Log Formats:** Different components using incompatible logging formats
- **Performance Impact from Logging:** Logging operations significantly affecting application performance

## Root Causes ▼

- **Inappropriate Log Levels:** Using wrong log levels (debug in production, error only in development)
- **Overly Verbose Logging:** Logging too much information, including sensitive data
- **Inconsistent Logging Standards:** Different parts of application using different logging approaches
- **Poor Log Rotation Configuration:** Logs not properly rotated or archived, causing storage issues
- **Security-Unaware Logging:** Logging sensitive information without considering security implications
- **Performance-Unaware Logging:** Logging configuration not considering performance impact

## Detection Methods ○

- **Log Volume Monitoring:** Monitor log generation rates and storage consumption
- **Sensitive Data Scanning:** Scan logs for accidentally logged sensitive information
- **Log Level Analysis:** Review log level configuration across different environments
- **Performance Impact Assessment:** Measure logging overhead on application performance
- **Log Format Consistency Review:** Ensure consistent log formats across application components

## Examples

A microservices application logs all HTTP requests and responses at DEBUG level in production, including request bodies containing user personal information and API keys. The logs quickly consume terabytes of storage and contain sensitive data accessible to anyone with log access. Performance suffers because high-frequency endpoints generate millions of log entries per hour. Another example involves a financial application where error logging is set to only capture ERROR level messages, missing WARNING level events that indicate potential security issues or system degradation. When fraud attempts occur, the warning-level security events aren't logged, making it impossible to detect patterns or investigate incidents effectively.
