## Description

Monolithic architecture constraints occur when applications are built as single, large codebases that become increasingly difficult to maintain, scale, and deploy as they grow. While monoliths can be appropriate for smaller applications, they create constraints around team autonomy, technology choices, scaling, and deployment flexibility as systems and organizations grow larger.

## Indicators ⟡

- Single codebase contains multiple distinct business domains
- Entire application must be deployed as one unit
- Different parts of application have vastly different scaling requirements
- Multiple teams working on same codebase with frequent conflicts
- Technology stack decisions affect entire application

## Symptoms ▲

- **Deployment Coupling:** Changes to any part require full application deployment
- **Scaling Inefficiencies:** Entire application must be scaled even if only parts need more resources
- **Technology Lock-in:** Difficult to adopt new technologies for specific components
- **Team Coordination Overhead:** Multiple teams coordinating changes to shared codebase
- **Build and Test Time Growth:** Build and test cycles become increasingly lengthy

## Root Causes ▼

- **Single Codebase Growth:** Application started small but grew without architectural evolution
- **Shared Database Design:** All components sharing same database making separation difficult
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns Integration:** Logging, security, and other concerns tightly integrated throughout
- **Lack of Domain Boundaries:** Business domains not properly separated within the codebase
- **Shared Dependencies:** Components sharing too many common libraries and frameworks
- **Organizational Structure Mismatch:** Team structure not aligned with code architecture

## Detection Methods ○

- **Codebase Size Analysis:** Monitor codebase growth and complexity metrics
- **Deployment Frequency Analysis:** Track how often different parts of application are deployed
- **Team Collaboration Metrics:** Monitor merge conflicts and coordination overhead
- **Build and Test Time Monitoring:** Track build and test execution times over time
- **Scaling Pattern Analysis:** Analyze whether different components have different scaling needs

## Examples

An e-commerce platform started as a simple web application but has grown to include inventory management, order processing, payment handling, customer service, and analytics all in one codebase. The inventory system needs to scale differently than the payment processor, but scaling requires deploying the entire application. When the payment team wants to adopt a new fraud detection library, it affects the entire application build process and requires coordination with all other teams. Deployment of a simple analytics feature requires regression testing the entire platform, slowing down release cycles. Another example involves a content management system that has grown to include user management, content editing, publishing workflows, and reporting. Different teams work on different features but constantly have merge conflicts because they're all modifying the same shared codebase, and a bug in the reporting feature can bring down the entire content editing system.
