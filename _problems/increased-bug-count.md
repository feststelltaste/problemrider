## Description

Increased bug count occurs when software changes consistently introduce new defects at a rate higher than normal development processes should produce. This problem manifests as a growing number of reported issues, frequent production incidents, and an overall decline in software quality. The increased defect rate often indicates underlying issues with development practices, code quality, or system architecture that make the software more prone to errors.

## Indicators ⟡

- Bug reports are increasing over time despite similar development activity levels
- New features consistently introduce unexpected side effects
- Production incidents occur more frequently after releases
- Testing discovers more defects than historically normal
- Bug fix cycles are becoming longer and more complex

## Symptoms ▲

- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** More bugs reach production users, causing service disruptions
- **[Constant Firefighting](constant-firefighting.md):** Development team spends increasing time fixing bugs rather than building features
- **Customer Dissatisfaction:** Users experience more problems and report issues more frequently
- **[Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md):** New functionality is delivered with more problems than expected
- **Testing Overhead:** More time must be spent on testing and quality assurance activities

## Root Causes ▼

- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Accumulated shortcuts and poor design decisions make the system more error-prone
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** Inadequate test coverage allows defects to slip through to production
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** Fragile code breaks easily when modifications are made
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Rushed development leads to more mistakes and less thorough quality checks
- **[Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md):** Poor review processes fail to catch defects before they're merged
- **Complexity Growth:** System complexity has increased beyond the team's ability to manage effectively

## Detection Methods ○

- **Bug Tracking Analysis:** Monitor bug report trends, severity distributions, and time-to-resolution metrics
- **Release Quality Metrics:** Track defects found per release and defect density in different code areas
- **Production Incident Tracking:** Monitor frequency and severity of production issues
- **Customer Support Metrics:** Analyze support ticket volume and types of issues reported
- **Code Quality Metrics:** Use static analysis tools to identify potentially problematic code areas

## Examples

An e-commerce platform that previously averaged 5 bug reports per release now consistently has 20+ bugs reported within the first week of each deployment. Investigation reveals that rapid feature development has introduced complex interdependencies between the shopping cart, inventory, and payment systems, causing seemingly unrelated changes to break functionality in unexpected ways. Another example involves a content management system where recent performance optimizations have introduced subtle data corruption issues that only surface under specific load conditions, leading to a 300% increase in customer-reported data inconsistencies.
