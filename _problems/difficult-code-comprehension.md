## Description
Difficult code comprehension is a situation where developers have a hard time understanding the codebase. This is a common problem in long-running projects, especially those that have been worked on by many different people over the years. Difficult code comprehension can lead to a number of problems, including a decrease in productivity, an increase in the number of bugs, and a general slowdown in development velocity.

## Indicators ⟡
- Developers are constantly asking for help to understand the codebase.
- It takes a long time for new developers to become productive.
- There is a lot of duplicated code.
- The codebase is a mixture of different styles and conventions.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Increased Cognitive Load](increased-cognitive-load.md):** Developers have to spend more time and mental energy to understand code because they cannot rely on consistent patterns.
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** It takes a long time to get things done because developers have a hard time understanding the codebase.
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** The number of bugs is increasing because developers do not have a good understanding of the codebase.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Developers get frustrated with the difficulty of understanding the codebase and the lack of progress.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** The codebase is inconsistent, which makes it difficult to read and understand.
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** The code is hard to understand due to convoluted logic, lack of comments, or poor naming conventions.
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** There is no documentation to help developers understand the codebase.
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** The knowledge about the codebase is not shared with the rest of the team.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they find the codebase easy to read and understand.
- **Code Reviews:** Look for code that is difficult to understand and review.
- **Static Analysis Tools:** Use tools to identify code smells, such as complex code and long methods.

## Examples
A developer is trying to fix a bug in a legacy module. The developer finds that the module is very difficult to understand. The code is a mixture of different styles and conventions, and there is no documentation. The developer spends a lot of time trying to understand the code, and they are not able to fix the bug. This is a common problem in companies that do not have a culture of writing clean, readable code.
