## Description

Increased cost of development occurs when the total expense of building and maintaining software becomes significantly higher than necessary due to quality issues, technical debt, or inefficient processes. This follows the principle that fixing problems becomes exponentially more expensive the later they're discovered in the development lifecycle. When systems accumulate technical debt and quality issues, every subsequent change becomes more expensive, creating a compounding effect on development costs.

## Indicators ⟡
- Development estimates consistently increase for similar types of work
- Bug fixing consumes a disproportionate amount of development resources
- Simple changes require extensive testing and risk mitigation
- Emergency fixes and production support require significant overtime
- Development velocity decreases while team size and costs increase

## Symptoms ▲
- **Budget Overruns:** Projects consistently exceed their allocated development budgets
- **Extended Timelines:** Features take longer to develop than originally estimated
- **Resource Intensive Maintenance:** Significant portion of development capacity is spent on maintenance rather than new features
- **Higher Staffing Costs:** More developers are needed to maintain the same level of output
- **Emergency Response Costs:** Frequent need for after-hours work and urgent fixes

## Root Causes ▼
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** Frequent bugs require expensive debugging and fixing efforts
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Accumulated shortcuts make every change more complex and risky
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** Fragile systems require extensive testing and careful modifications
- **Poor Quality Practices:** Lack of testing, code reviews, or quality assurance increases long-term costs
- **Reactive Development:** Spending time on firefighting rather than preventive measures
- **Inefficient Processes:** Wasteful workflows and excessive bureaucracy add unnecessary overhead

## Detection Methods ○
- **Cost Per Feature Tracking:** Monitor the total cost to deliver similar features over time
- **Maintenance vs. Development Ratio:** Track what percentage of resources goes to maintenance vs. new development
- **Bug Fix Cost Analysis:** Calculate the total cost of fixing bugs compared to feature development
- **Velocity vs. Team Size:** Compare development output to team size and costs over time
- **Technical Debt Impact Assessment:** Quantify how technical debt affects development estimates

## Examples

A legacy e-commerce system has accumulated significant technical debt over five years. What originally took 2 weeks and $10,000 in development costs to add a new payment method now takes 8 weeks and $40,000 because developers must work around architectural limitations, update multiple interconnected modules, and conduct extensive testing to avoid breaking existing functionality. The company calculates that they're spending 70% of their development budget on maintenance and technical debt remediation, leaving only 30% for new features that could generate revenue. A simple bug fix that would have taken 2 hours to resolve if caught during development now requires 2 weeks of investigation, fixes across multiple components, and extensive regression testing because it was discovered in production. Another example involves a healthcare application where poor initial architecture decisions mean that adding HIPAA compliance features requires modifying the entire data access layer. What should have been a 1-month project becomes a 6-month effort costing $500,000 because the system wasn't designed with security and compliance in mind. The cost of retrofitting security is ten times higher than it would have been to build it correctly from the beginning.
