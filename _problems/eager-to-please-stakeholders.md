## Description
An eagerness to please stakeholders is a common problem in software development. It occurs when the project team agrees to every new request from the stakeholders without pushing back or explaining the trade-offs. This can lead to a number of problems, including scope creep, constantly shifting deadlines, and budget overruns. An eagerness to please stakeholders is often a sign of a weak project team or a lack of a strong product owner.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team is constantly saying yes to new requests.
- The team is not explaining the trade-offs of new requests.
- The team is not pushing back on unreasonable requests.
- The team is not focused on the project's goals.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** The project's scope is constantly expanding.
- **[Feature Creep](feature-creep.md):** The set of features to implement is constantly expanding.
- **[Constantly Shifting Deadlines](constantly-shifting-deadlines.md):** The project's end date is repeatedly pushed back.
- **[Budget Overruns](budget-overruns.md):** The project costs more than originally planned.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The constant churn and lack of progress can have a negative impact on team morale.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Fear of Conflict](fear-of-conflict.md):** The team may be afraid to push back on stakeholders for fear of conflict.
- **[Product Direction Chaos](product-direction-chaos.md):** A weak product owner may be unable to say no to stakeholders.
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** Without a clear product vision, it is difficult to say no to new feature requests.
- **A Desire to Be a Team Player:** The team may want to be seen as team players, and they may be reluctant to say no to new requests.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Change Request Log:** Keep a log of all change requests and see how many of them are being approved.
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss the team's relationship with the stakeholders in your retrospectives.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Listen to stakeholder feedback to see if they are happy with the team's performance.
- **Project Metrics:** Track project metrics, such as scope, schedule, and budget, to see if they are being impacted by an eagerness to please stakeholders.

## Examples
A team is building a new website. The team is very eager to please the stakeholders. The team agrees to every new request from the stakeholders without pushing back or explaining the trade-offs. As a result, the project's scope is constantly expanding. The project is delivered late and over budget. The stakeholders are not happy.
