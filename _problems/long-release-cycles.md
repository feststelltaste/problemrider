## Description

Long release cycles occur when the time between software releases becomes excessive due to prolonged testing phases, extensive manual verification processes, or frequent discovery of issues late in the release process. This problem creates a bottleneck in delivering value to users and often results in larger, riskier releases that are even more difficult to test and deploy. Long cycles can become self-reinforcing as teams try to pack more features into infrequent releases, making each release even larger and more complex.

## Indicators ⟡
- Releases happen monthly, quarterly, or even less frequently when they should be more regular
- Significant portions of the release cycle are spent on manual testing or bug fixing
- Release dates are frequently postponed due to quality concerns
- Large amounts of code changes accumulate between releases
- The team spends weeks preparing for each release

## Symptoms ▲
- **Delayed Value Delivery:** Users wait months for bug fixes or new features
- **Large, Risky Releases:** Each release contains extensive changes that are difficult to verify
- **Release Anxiety:** Teams are nervous about deployments due to their size and complexity
- **User Frustration:** Customers express impatience with slow feature delivery or bug fixes
- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Slower time-to-market compared to competitors with more frequent releases

## Root Causes ▼
- **Lack of Automated Tests:** Extensive manual testing is required to verify each release
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** Poor testing practices lead to bug discoveries late in the release cycle
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** Changes are risky and require extensive verification
- **Complex Deployment Process:** Manual deployment procedures that are time-consuming and error-prone
- **Perfectionist Culture:** Reluctance to release until every possible issue is addressed
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited testing or operations personnel create bottlenecks in the release process

## Detection Methods ○
- **Release Frequency Metrics:** Track time between releases and compare to industry standards or goals
- **Release Preparation Time:** Measure how long teams spend preparing for each release
- **Bug Discovery Timing:** Monitor when bugs are found in the release cycle (late discovery indicates process issues)
- **Feature Delivery Time:** Track how long features take from completion to user availability
- **Release Size Analysis:** Measure the amount of code or number of features per release

## Examples

A software company releases updates every six months because each release requires four weeks of manual testing across different browsers, operating systems, and device configurations. During the testing phase, they typically discover 20-30 bugs that require fixes, which then need additional testing, extending the cycle further. By the time a release is ready, it contains six months' worth of changes, making it extremely difficult to identify the root cause of any issues that arise. Users frequently request features or bug fixes but must wait months to receive them. Another example involves a financial services application where regulatory compliance requires extensive documentation and approval processes for each release. The company batches changes into quarterly releases to minimize the overhead of compliance processes, but this means critical security patches or user-requested features can take up to four months to reach production, creating business risk and user dissatisfaction.
