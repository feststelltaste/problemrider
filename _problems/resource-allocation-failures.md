## Description

Resource allocation failures occur when applications acquire system resources such as file handles, database connections, network sockets, or memory allocations but fail to properly release them when they are no longer needed. This leads to resource exhaustion where the system runs out of available resources, causing application failures, performance degradation, or system instability. The problem is particularly severe in long-running applications and servers.

## Indicators ⟡

- Application fails to open files or establish connections after running for a period
- System reports "too many open files" or similar resource limit errors
- Database connection pool exhausts available connections
- Network socket operations fail with resource unavailable errors
- System monitoring shows steadily increasing resource usage without corresponding deallocation

## Symptoms ▲

- **Resource Pool Exhaustion:** Connection pools, file handle limits, or other resource pools become depleted
- **[Service Timeouts](service-timeouts.md):** Operations fail due to inability to acquire necessary resources
- **Application Crashes:** System terminates application when resource limits are exceeded
- **[Memory Leaks](memory-leaks.md):** Memory resources are not properly returned to the system
- **System Instability:** Operating system becomes unstable due to resource depletion

## Root Causes ▼

- **Missing Try-Finally Blocks:** Resources are acquired but not released in error conditions due to inadequate exception handling
- **Exception Handling Gaps:** Exceptions prevent resource cleanup code from executing
- **Resource Management Discipline:** Developers forget to explicitly close or dispose of resources after use
- **Complex Control Flow:** Multiple return paths or complex logic make it difficult to ensure resource cleanup
- **Third-Party Library Issues:** External libraries fail to properly manage their internal resources
- **Asynchronous Operation Complexity:** Resources acquired in async operations are not properly cleaned up in all execution paths

## Detection Methods ○

- **Resource Monitoring Tools:** Use system monitoring to track file handles, connections, and other resource usage over time
- **Application Profiling:** Profile applications to identify resource acquisition and release patterns
- **Static Code Analysis:** Analyze code for resource acquisition without corresponding cleanup
- **Load Testing:** Run sustained load tests to identify resource leaks under operational conditions
- **System Resource Limits:** Monitor system-level resource consumption and limits
- **Connection Pool Monitoring:** Track database and network connection pool utilization

## Examples

A web service opens database connections to process requests but fails to close them in error conditions. After handling several thousand requests with intermittent errors, the connection pool is exhausted and new requests cannot be processed, requiring application restart. Another example involves a file processing application that opens file handles to read configuration files but doesn't close them in a finally block. Over time, the application reaches the operating system's file handle limit and crashes when trying to open additional files, even though the files it was trying to access are no longer being used by the application logic.
