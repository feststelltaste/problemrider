## Description

Defensive coding practices occur when developers modify their coding style not to improve functionality or maintainability, but to avoid anticipated criticism during code reviews. This includes writing unnecessarily verbose code, adding excessive comments to justify every decision, implementing overly defensive error handling, or choosing conservative approaches that are less efficient but harder to criticize. While some defensive programming is beneficial, this problem represents coding decisions driven by fear of review feedback rather than technical merit.

## Indicators ⟡

- Code contains far more comments than necessary, often explaining obvious operations
- Developers choose less efficient but "safer" implementations to avoid review debates
- Variable names become excessively long and descriptive to prevent naming criticism
- Code includes unnecessary error handling for impossible scenarios
- Developers mention modifying code specifically to avoid review comments

## Symptoms ▲

- **Code becomes unnecessarily long and complex due to defensive additions**
- **[Gradual Performance Degradation](gradual-performance-degradation.md):** Overly defensive implementations can be less efficient than necessary
- **Fear-driven decisions compromise clean, elegant solutions**
- **Coding decisions are driven by fear rather than technical judgment**
- **[Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md):** Conservative choices prevent exploration of better approaches

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Author Frustration](author-frustration.md):** Previous negative review experiences drive preventive measures
- **[Nitpicking Culture](nitpicking-culture.md):** Excessive focus on minor details encourages over-defensive coding
- **[Conflicting Reviewer Opinions](conflicting-reviewer-opinions.md):** Inconsistent review feedback makes defensive approaches seem safer
- **[Blame Culture](blame-culture.md):** Environment where mistakes are criticized harshly encourages defensive measures
- **[Code Review Inefficiency](code-review-inefficiency.md):** Unclear expectations lead to over-preparation for all possible criticism

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Complexity Analysis:** Compare code complexity before and after review experiences
- **Comment Density Assessment:** Measure comment-to-code ratios and evaluate comment necessity
- **Performance Impact Evaluation:** Assess whether defensive practices impact system performance
- **Developer Behavior Surveys:** Collect feedback on coding decision motivations
- **Code Style Evolution Tracking:** Monitor how coding patterns change in response to review feedback

## Examples

A developer who previously received extensive feedback about variable naming starts using extremely long, descriptive names like `userAuthenticationTokenValidationResult` instead of `authResult`, making the code harder to read but hoping to prevent naming criticism. They also add comments for every line explaining obvious operations like `// Increment counter by 1` and `// Check if user exists` to demonstrate thorough documentation. The resulting code is twice as long as necessary and actually harder to understand despite the "improvements." Another example involves a developer who implements triple-nested error handling for scenarios that cannot realistically occur because a previous reviewer questioned their error handling approach. They add validation for impossible conditions and defensive checks that will never trigger, significantly complicating the code logic and impacting performance, all to avoid potential criticism about inadequate error handling.
