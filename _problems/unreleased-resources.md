## Description

Unreleased resources occur when applications acquire system resources such as memory, file handles, database connections, network sockets, or other finite resources but fail to properly release them when they're no longer needed. This leads to resource exhaustion over time, degraded performance, and eventual system instability. Unlike simple memory leaks, this problem encompasses all types of system resources and can manifest in various ways depending on which resources are not being properly managed.

## Indicators ⟡
- System resource usage continuously increases during application runtime
- Applications eventually crash with "out of memory" or "too many open files" errors
- Database connection pools become exhausted
- Network connections remain in TIME_WAIT state for extended periods
- Performance degrades as the application runs longer

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Memory Leaks](memory-leaks.md):** Specific case where memory resources are not properly deallocated
- **Connection Pool Exhaustion:** Database or network connection pools run out of available connections
- **File Handle Leaks:** System runs out of available file descriptors
- **[Gradual Performance Degradation](gradual-performance-degradation.md):** System performance slowly deteriorates as resources become scarce
- **System Crashes:** Applications crash when system resource limits are reached

## Root Causes ▼
- **Missing Finally Blocks:** Resources opened in try-catch blocks are not closed in finally clauses
- **Exception Handling Gaps:** Resources are not released when exceptions occur during processing
- **[Circular References](circular-references.md):** Objects with circular references prevent garbage collection from releasing resources
- **Missing Resource Disposal:** Developers forget to call close(), dispose(), or cleanup methods
- **Incorrect Resource Management Patterns:** Using inappropriate patterns for resource lifecycle management
- **Library or Framework Bugs:** Third-party components that don't properly manage their own resources

## Detection Methods ○
- **Resource Monitoring Tools:** System-level monitoring of memory, file handles, network connections, and other resources
- **Application Profiling:** Memory and resource profilers that can track resource allocation and deallocation
- **Static Code Analysis:** Tools that can identify potential resource leaks in code
- **Load Testing:** Extended testing that can reveal resource leaks over time
- **System Log Analysis:** Monitor system logs for resource exhaustion errors or warnings

## Examples

A web application opens database connections to generate reports but fails to close them properly when exceptions occur during report processing. Over time, the connection pool becomes exhausted, and new users cannot access the application because no database connections are available. The connections remain allocated in the database server until it's restarted, even though the application is no longer using them. Another example involves a file processing service that opens file handles to read configuration files but never closes them. As the application processes more requests, it accumulates open file handles until it reaches the system limit. At that point, the application can no longer open any files, including log files, causing it to crash with "too many open files" errors. The problem is particularly difficult to diagnose because it only manifests after the application has been running for extended periods and processed many requests.
