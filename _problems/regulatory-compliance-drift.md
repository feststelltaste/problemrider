## Description

Regulatory compliance drift occurs when legacy systems gradually fall behind evolving regulatory requirements due to their inability to adapt to new compliance standards, reporting formats, or legal obligations. This problem develops over time as regulations change but legacy systems lack the flexibility to implement required updates, creating increasing compliance risk and potential legal exposure. Unlike initial compliance failures, this involves systems that were once compliant but have become non-compliant due to regulatory evolution and system inflexibility.

## Indicators ⟡

- New regulatory requirements that cannot be easily implemented in existing legacy systems
- Compliance reporting that requires manual processes or workarounds to meet current standards
- Audit findings that highlight outdated compliance implementations or missing regulatory features
- Legal or compliance teams expressing concerns about the system's ability to meet evolving requirements
- Increasing manual effort required to maintain compliance as regulations become more complex
- System architecture that was designed for older regulatory frameworks and cannot adapt to new ones
- Vendor notifications that legacy system compliance features will no longer be supported or updated

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Insufficient Audit Logging](insufficient-audit-logging.md):** Failed regulatory audits or compliance examinations due to system limitations
- **[Budget Overruns](budget-overruns.md):** Fines or penalties imposed by regulatory bodies for non-compliance
- **[Increased Manual Work](increased-manual-work.md):** Increased manual processes and oversight required to maintain regulatory compliance
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** Inability to operate in new markets or jurisdictions due to compliance limitations
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** Competitive disadvantage due to inability to meet modern regulatory standards
- **[Data Protection Risk](data-protection-risk.md):** Legal risk exposure from operating with non-compliant systems
- **[High Maintenance Costs](high-maintenance-costs.md):** Escalating costs for compliance management and manual reporting processes
- **[Inability to Innovate](inability-to-innovate.md):** Business opportunities lost due to inability to meet regulatory requirements for new services
- **[Operational Overhead](operational-overhead.md):** Additional staff and processes needed to manage compliance gaps
- **[Stakeholder Confidence Loss](stakeholder-confidence-loss.md):** Regulatory body and stakeholder concern about compliance capabilities
- **[Negative Brand Perception](negative-brand-perception.md):** Reputation damage from compliance failures and regulatory attention
- **[Constant Firefighting](constant-firefighting.md):** Ongoing crisis management to address compliance gaps and regulatory findings
- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Reluctance to modify systems due to compliance complexity and risk
- **[User Trust Erosion](user-trust-erosion.md):** Customer and partner concern about data protection and regulatory compliance

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Obsolete Technologies](obsolete-technologies.md):** Legacy systems designed when regulatory requirements were simpler or different
- **[Stagnant Architecture](stagnant-architecture.md):** Lack of flexibility in legacy architecture to accommodate regulatory changes
- **[Short-Term Focus](short-term-focus.md):** Insufficient investment in system updates to maintain compliance over time
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Regulatory changes that occur faster than system modernization cycles
- **[Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md):** Complex legacy systems where compliance changes require significant architectural modifications
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Limited expertise in both legacy system capabilities and evolving regulatory requirements
- **[Resource Allocation Failures](resource-allocation-failures.md):** Budget constraints that defer compliance-related system improvements
- **[Poor Operational Concept](poor-operational-concept.md):** Organizational focus on functional features rather than regulatory infrastructure maintenance
- **[Legacy Business Logic Extraction Difficulty](legacy-business-logic-extraction-difficulty.md):** Compliance rules embedded in legacy code that cannot be easily modified
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Technical debt that makes compliance updates prohibitively expensive
- **[Vendor Dependency Entrapment](vendor-dependency-entrapment.md):** Reliance on legacy vendors who no longer provide compliance updates
- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Lack of proactive planning for regulatory change management
- **[Legacy Configuration Management Chaos](legacy-configuration-management-chaos.md):** Configuration systems that cannot accommodate new compliance requirements
- **[Data Migration Integrity Issues](data-migration-integrity-issues.md):** Data quality problems that prevent compliance reporting accuracy
- **[Resistance to Change](resistance-to-change.md):** Organizational resistance to the system changes required for compliance

## Detection Methods ○

- Conduct regular compliance gap analyses comparing current system capabilities with regulatory requirements
- Monitor regulatory change announcements and assess system impact early
- Track compliance-related manual processes and workarounds that indicate system limitations
- Review audit findings and regulatory examination results for system-related compliance issues
- Assess competitive positioning related to regulatory compliance capabilities
- Monitor legal and compliance team workload increases related to system limitations
- Evaluate business opportunity losses due to compliance-related system constraints
- Track costs associated with maintaining compliance through manual processes or system workarounds

## Examples

A regional bank's loan origination system was built in 2005 to comply with existing fair lending and disclosure regulations. Over the years, new regulations have introduced requirements for enhanced data collection, real-time risk assessment, and detailed audit trails that the legacy system cannot support. When new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules require specific data fields and reporting formats, the IT team discovers that adding these capabilities would require rebuilding core system components. The bank must implement manual processes where loan officers print applications, fill out supplementary forms by hand, and re-enter data into compliance tracking spreadsheets. During a regulatory examination, auditors find that the manual processes have introduced data inconsistencies and incomplete audit trails that violate current regulations. The bank faces potential fines and is required to submit a remediation plan, but modernizing the system to meet current compliance requirements is estimated to take 3 years and cost $50 million. Meanwhile, competitors with modern systems can offer new loan products and serve customers more efficiently because their systems natively support current regulatory requirements.
