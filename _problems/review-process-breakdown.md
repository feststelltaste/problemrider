## Description

Review process breakdown occurs when code review practices systematically fail to achieve their intended goals of improving code quality, knowledge sharing, and defect prevention. This manifests as reviews that are rushed, superficial, inconsistent, or avoided entirely, creating a false sense of security while allowing quality issues to accumulate in the codebase. The breakdown often stems from misaligned incentives, process friction, or cultural issues that make effective review difficult or unrewarding.

## Indicators ⟡

- Code reviews consistently miss obvious bugs or design flaws that later appear in production
- Reviews focus primarily on formatting and style rather than logic, architecture, or maintainability
- Large changes are approved with minimal discussion or feedback
- Review turnaround time is either too slow (blocking development) or too fast (indicating superficial review)
- The same types of issues are repeatedly identified in production despite code review processes

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Superficial Code Reviews](superficial-code-reviews.md):** Reviews provide "looks good to me" approval without thorough examination
- **[Review Bottlenecks](review-bottlenecks.md):** Code review process becomes a significant constraint on development velocity
- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** Bugs escape to production despite review processes
- **[Inconsistent Quality](inconsistent-quality.md):** Code quality varies significantly across different parts of the system
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Review process fails to transfer knowledge between team members
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Reviews become source of conflict rather than collaboration

## Root Causes ▼

- **Time Pressure:** Reviews are rushed due to deadline pressure, leading to superficial examination
- **Review Scope Problems:** Changes are too large or complex for effective review
- **Skill Mismatches:** Reviewers lack expertise to evaluate the code being reviewed
- **Process Friction:** Review tools and workflows create barriers to effective feedback
- **Cultural Issues:** Reviews become adversarial rather than collaborative learning opportunities
- **Unclear Standards:** Team lacks shared understanding of what constitutes good code
- **Inadequate Context:** Reviewers don't understand the business requirements or technical constraints
- **Review Fatigue:** Reviewers become overwhelmed and default to quick approvals

## Detection Methods ○

- **Review Quality Analysis:** Track whether issues found in production could have been caught in review
- **Review Participation Metrics:** Monitor reviewer engagement, feedback quality, and discussion depth
- **Review Turnaround Time:** Measure time between review request and meaningful feedback
- **Post-Review Bug Tracking:** Analyze whether review process effectively prevents defects
- **Knowledge Transfer Assessment:** Evaluate whether reviews successfully share knowledge across team
- **Review Process Surveys:** Ask team members about review effectiveness and pain points

## Examples

A development team has established code review requirements, but reviewers consistently approve large pull requests within minutes of submission with comments like "LGTM" without asking questions or providing feedback. When production bugs occur, investigation reveals that the issues would have been obvious to any reviewer who examined the code logic carefully. The team discovers that reviewers feel pressure to approve quickly to avoid blocking development, and there's an unspoken understanding that thorough review is less important than fast approval. Another example involves a team where code reviews devolve into arguments about code formatting and variable naming while missing significant design flaws, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. The review process becomes focused on subjective style preferences rather than identifying actual problems that will affect system reliability and maintainability.
