## Description

Environment variable issues occur when applications rely on environment variables for configuration but these variables are improperly managed, missing, inconsistent across environments, or contain sensitive information that isn't properly secured. Poor environment variable management can lead to application failures, security vulnerabilities, and difficult-to-debug configuration problems.

## Indicators ⟡

- Applications fail to start due to missing environment variables
- Different behavior across environments due to inconsistent variable values
- Sensitive information like passwords or API keys stored in environment variables
- Environment variables not properly validated or have default values that cause issues
- Configuration changes require restarting applications or services

## Symptoms ▲

- **Application Startup Failures:** Applications crash or fail to initialize due to missing variables
- **Configuration Inconsistencies:** Different behavior across environments due to variable differences
- **Security Exposure:** Sensitive credentials exposed through environment variable listings
- **Default Value Problems:** Applications using inappropriate default values when variables are missing
- **Runtime Configuration Errors:** Invalid environment variable values causing runtime failures

## Root Causes ▼

- **Missing Environment Variables:** Required variables not set in deployment environments
- **Inconsistent Variable Names:** Different variable names used across environments or services
- **Inadequate Variable Validation:** Applications not validating environment variable values
- **Insecure Credential Storage:** Storing sensitive data like passwords in environment variables
- **Poor Default Value Handling:** Inappropriate or missing default values for optional variables
- **Environment Variable Proliferation:** Too many variables making configuration management complex

## Detection Methods ○

- **Environment Variable Auditing:** Regularly audit environment variables across all environments
- **Application Startup Testing:** Test application startup with various environment variable configurations
- **Security Scanning:** Scan for sensitive information stored in environment variables
- **Configuration Validation:** Implement validation for all environment variable inputs
- **Cross-Environment Comparison:** Compare environment variables across different deployment environments

## Examples

A microservices application requires 15 different environment variables for database connections, API keys, and feature flags. During a production deployment, one environment variable `DATABASE_TIMEOUT` is set to "30s" instead of "30" (missing the numeric format). The application interprets this as 0 and immediately times out all database connections, causing complete service failure. The error is difficult to diagnose because the application doesn't validate environment variable formats and the logs only show generic timeout errors. Another example involves storing database passwords directly in environment variables, which become visible to all processes and users with system access. When developers run `printenv` for debugging, all credentials are exposed in terminal logs and potentially in log files.
