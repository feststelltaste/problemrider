## Description

Tight coupling issues occur when system components are overly dependent on each other's internal implementations, making it difficult to modify, test, or replace individual components without affecting others. Tightly coupled systems are fragile, difficult to maintain, and resist change because modifications in one area often require changes throughout the system.

## Indicators ⟡

- Changes to one component frequently require changes to many other components
- Components cannot be tested in isolation without complex setup
- Circular dependencies between modules or classes
- Components accessing each other's internal data structures directly
- Difficulty replacing or upgrading individual components

## Symptoms ▲

- **Change Amplification:** Small changes ripple through multiple system components
- **[Testing Complexity](testing-complexity.md):** Cannot test components independently without extensive mocking
- **Circular Dependencies:** Components depending on each other creating dependency cycles
- **Direct Data Access:** Components bypassing interfaces to access internal data structures
- **Component Replacement Difficulty:** Cannot easily swap or upgrade individual components

## Root Causes ▼

- **Shared State Access:** Multiple components directly accessing and modifying shared state
- **Implementation Exposure:** Components exposing internal implementation details to others
- **Lack of Abstraction Layers:** Direct dependencies between components without interface abstractions
- **God Object Pattern:** Single classes or components handling too many responsibilities
- **Database Schema Coupling:** Multiple components tightly coupled to specific database schemas
- **Cross-Cutting Concern Integration:** Logging, security, and monitoring tightly woven throughout code

## Detection Methods ○

- **Dependency Analysis:** Analyze component dependencies and identify tight coupling patterns
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Track how changes in one component affect others
- **Cyclic Dependency Detection:** Identify circular dependencies between components
- **Interface vs Implementation Analysis:** Review how components interact with each other
- **Component Isolation Testing:** Test ability to run and test components independently

## Examples

An e-commerce order processing system has tight coupling between the inventory, payment, and shipping components. The inventory component directly accesses the payment database to check payment status, the payment component modifies inventory quantities directly, and the shipping component reads order data directly from payment tables. When the payment system needs to be upgraded to support new payment methods, it requires changes to all three components because they're all tightly coupled to the specific payment database schema and internal payment processing logic. Another example involves a user interface where UI components directly call business logic methods and access database entities. When the business logic needs to change, it breaks multiple UI components, and when the database schema changes, both business logic and UI components need updates, making any change expensive and risky.
