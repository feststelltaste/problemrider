## Description
Complex and obscure logic is code that is difficult to read, understand, and reason about. This can be due to a variety of factors, including convoluted control flow, unclear naming, a lack of comments, or the use of overly clever or esoteric language features. This type of code is a significant contributor to technical debt, as it is difficult and risky to maintain or modify.

## Indicators ⟡
- Developers avoid working on certain parts of the codebase.
- It takes a long time for new developers to become productive in a particular area of the code.
- There are frequent discussions and debates about how a particular piece of code works.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md): The code is difficult to change without introducing new bugs.
- [High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md): The code is a significant source of ongoing maintenance costs.
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** It takes a long time to add new features or fix bugs in the affected area.
- **[Increased Risk of Bugs](increased-risk-of-bugs.md):** The complexity of the code makes it more likely that developers will introduce new bugs when making changes.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** The original requirements were not well-defined, leading to a convoluted implementation.
- **[Inexperienced Developers](inexperienced-developers.md):** The code was written by developers who did not have the experience to write clear and maintainable code.
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** The code was written under tight deadlines, leading to shortcuts and a lack of attention to clarity.
- **[Clever Code](clever-code.md):** The original author prioritized demonstrating their technical prowess over writing code that is easy for others to understand.
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Tightly coupled components with mixed responsibilities create complex interdependencies.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Complexity Metrics:** Use static analysis tools to measure metrics like cyclomatic complexity, which can help to identify overly complex code.
- **Code Reviews:** Pay close attention to code that is difficult to understand during code reviews.
- **Developer Feedback:** Solicit feedback from developers about which parts of the codebase are the most difficult to work with.

## Examples
A function that is supposed to perform a simple calculation is written as a single, massive block of nested `if-else` statements with no comments and cryptic variable names. It takes a new developer days to understand what the function is doing, and even then, they are not confident enough to make changes to it for fear of breaking something. This is a classic example of how complex and obscure logic can create a significant maintenance burden.
