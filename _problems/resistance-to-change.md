## Description

Resistance to change occurs when development teams consistently avoid making necessary improvements, refactoring, or modernization efforts due to concerns about risk, effort, or disruption. This resistance can stem from past negative experiences, lack of confidence in the team's ability to manage change safely, or organizational culture that discourages taking risks. Over time, this resistance leads to system stagnation and accumulating technical debt.

## Indicators ⟡

- Improvement initiatives are consistently postponed or canceled
- Team discussions about refactoring focus primarily on risks rather than benefits
- Workarounds are preferred over fixing underlying problems
- New requirements are implemented as additions rather than improvements to existing code
- Proposals for system improvements receive skeptical or negative responses

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Stagnant Architecture](stagnant-architecture.md):** System design doesn't evolve to meet changing needs
- **[Accumulation of Workarounds](accumulation-of-workarounds.md):** Complex patches are layered on top of existing problems
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Technical debt continues to accumulate without being addressed
- **Declining System Performance:** Performance issues persist because optimization efforts are avoided
- **Innovation Stagnation:** New technologies and practices aren't adopted due to change resistance

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Deep-seated concern about breaking existing functionality
- **[Maintenance Paralysis](maintenance-paralysis.md):** Inability to verify that changes won't cause problems
- **Past Negative Experiences:** Previous refactoring or improvement efforts resulted in significant problems
- **Risk-Averse Culture:** Organizational culture that heavily penalizes mistakes while not rewarding improvements
- **Resource Constraints:** Perception that improvement efforts take time away from "real work"
- **Lack of Change Management Skills:** Team doesn't have experience or confidence in managing complex changes

## Detection Methods ○

- **Improvement Proposal Tracking:** Monitor how many improvement initiatives are started vs. completed
- **Code Age Analysis:** Identify areas of code that haven't been improved despite known issues
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss attitudes toward change and improvement efforts
- **Technical Debt Trend Analysis:** Track whether technical debt is increasing or decreasing over time
- **Decision Pattern Analysis:** Look for patterns of choosing workarounds over fundamental fixes

## Examples

A development team identifies that their authentication system needs modernization to support new security requirements, but every discussion about updating it ends with concerns about breaking existing integrations. Instead of modernizing the system, they continue adding patch-like security measures that increase complexity while leaving fundamental vulnerabilities unaddressed. Another example involves a team that knows their database design is causing performance problems, but they resist redesigning the schema because they're afraid of data migration risks, instead implementing increasingly complex caching layers that add operational overhead without solving the root performance issues.
