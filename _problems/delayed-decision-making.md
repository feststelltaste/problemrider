## Description

Delayed decision making occurs when important decisions that affect development work are postponed, take excessive time to make, or get stuck in approval processes. This delay creates uncertainty for team members, blocks progress on dependent work, and can lead to missed opportunities or suboptimal outcomes when decisions are finally made under time pressure. The problem often stems from unclear decision-making authority, fear of making wrong choices, or overly complex approval processes.

## Indicators ⟡

- Development work is frequently blocked waiting for decisions
- The same decisions are discussed repeatedly without resolution
- Decision makers request excessive analysis before making choices
- Important decisions are made at the last minute under pressure
- Team members are unclear about who has authority to make specific types of decisions

## Symptoms ▲

- **Work Blocking:** Development tasks cannot proceed without pending decisions
- **Planning Inefficiency:** Project planning is hampered by uncertain decisions
- **Team Frustration:** Developers become frustrated with lack of direction and clarity
- **Missed Opportunities:** Delays in decision making cause missed business opportunities
- **Suboptimal Outcomes:** Rushed decisions made under pressure lead to poor choices

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Decision Avoidance](decision-avoidance.md):** Decision makers avoid making difficult or risky choices
- **[Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md):** Excessive analysis prevents timely decision making
- **Unclear Decision Authority:** No clear ownership of decision-making responsibility
- **Fear of Wrong Decisions:** Fear of making mistakes causes delay and procrastination
- **[Approval Dependencies](approval-dependencies.md):** Too many stakeholders must approve decisions

## Detection Methods ○

- **Decision Tracking:** Monitor how long different types of decisions take from identification to resolution
- **Blocked Work Analysis:** Track how often development work is blocked waiting for decisions
- **Decision Backlog Assessment:** Identify pending decisions and their impact on project progress
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Collect input on decision-making effectiveness from team members
- **Decision Quality Review:** Assess whether delayed decisions actually result in better outcomes

## Examples

A development team needs to choose between two different database technologies for a new feature, but management has been discussing the decision for six weeks without reaching a conclusion. Meanwhile, the development team cannot proceed with implementation because the database choice affects the entire architecture. Team members spend time researching both options repeatedly, creating prototypes that may not be used, and attending multiple meetings that don't result in decisions. Eventually, the decision is made hastily to meet a deadline, without proper consideration of all the research that was conducted. Another example involves an API design decision where the team needs to choose between REST and GraphQL approaches. The decision gets escalated through multiple layers of management, with each level requesting additional analysis and documentation. Three months later, when the decision is finally made, the business requirements have changed and the original analysis is no longer relevant.
