## Description
Difficult code reuse is a common problem in software development. It occurs when it is difficult to reuse code in different contexts because it is not designed in a modular and reusable way. This can lead to a number of problems, including code duplication, a high degree of coupling, and a system that is difficult to maintain and evolve. Difficult code reuse is often a sign of a lack of experience with software design principles and patterns.

## Indicators ⟡
- The codebase is full of duplicated code.
- The components of the system are tightly coupled.
- It is difficult to extract a component from the system and reuse it in another context.
- The team is constantly reinventing the wheel.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Code Duplication](code-duplication.md):** The same code is duplicated in multiple places.
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** The components of the system are tightly coupled and have low cohesion.
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** It takes a long time to develop new features because the team is constantly reinventing the wheel.
- **[Increased Cost of Development](increased-cost-of-development.md):** The cost of developing and maintaining the system is inflated due to the high degree of code duplication.

## Root Causes ▼



- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** A focus on short-term deadlines can lead to a neglect of good design principles.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Duplication Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify duplicated code.
- **Dependency Analysis:** Analyze the dependencies between the components of the system to identify areas of high coupling.
- **Code Reviews:** Code reviews are a great way to identify opportunities for code reuse.
- **Component Library Audit:** Audit the team's component library to see if it is being used effectively.

## Examples
A company has a number of different web applications. Each application has its own implementation of a user authentication system. This is an example of difficult code reuse. The problem could be solved by creating a single, reusable user authentication component that can be used by all of the company's web applications. This would reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and make it easier to add new features to the user authentication system.
