## Description
A formal change control process is essential for managing the evolution of a project's scope and requirements. Without one, projects are vulnerable to scope creep, where new features and changes are added without proper evaluation of their impact on timelines, budgets, or resources. This can lead to a chaotic development process, missed deadlines, and a final product that does not align with the original vision. A lack of formal change control often stems from a desire to be flexible and responsive, but it ultimately undermines the project's stability and success.

## Indicators ⟡
- The project's scope is constantly expanding.
- The team is frequently missing deadlines.
- The team is constantly context-switching.
- There is a lot of rework.

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** The project's scope continuously expands without proper management or impact analysis.
- **Constantly Shifting Deadlines:** Project timelines are frequently missed or extended due to new, unmanaged requests.
- **Budget Overruns:** Projects exceed their allocated budget because of additional, unplanned work.
- **Rework and Waste:** Development teams spend time building features that are later changed or discarded due to unmanaged requirement shifts.
- **Lack of Accountability:** It's unclear who approved a change or why, making it difficult to trace decisions.
- **Team Frustration:** Developers and project managers are frustrated by the constant changes and lack of stability.

## Root Causes ▼

- **Lack of Defined Process:** There is no documented or agreed-upon process for how changes to requirements or scope should be requested, reviewed, and approved.
- **Informal Communication:** Changes are communicated verbally, through chat messages, or in ad-hoc meetings, rather than through a formal system.
- **Eager to Please Stakeholders:** The project team agrees to every new request without proper evaluation of its impact on the project.
- **No Central Authority:** There is no single person or committee responsible for approving or rejecting changes.
- **Lack of Impact Analysis:** New requests are not properly assessed for their impact on existing features, timelines, resources, or budget.
- **Fear of Bureaucracy:** Teams avoid formal processes, perceiving them as overly bureaucratic and slow.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Project Audits:** Review project documentation, meeting minutes, and communication logs to see how changes are being managed.
- **Compare Baselines:** Regularly compare the current project scope and plan against the initial baseline to identify unmanaged deviations.
- **Stakeholder Interviews:** Ask stakeholders and team members about their experience with managing changes and their understanding of the process.
- **Track Rework Metrics:** Monitor the amount of development effort spent on re-implementing or modifying already completed features.

## Examples
A software development project is nearing its release date. A key business stakeholder casually mentions in a hallway conversation that a critical new report is needed before launch. Without a formal change control process, this request is immediately added to the development backlog, causing a significant delay to the release and impacting other planned features. In another case, a team is building a mobile application. Over several months, various product managers and designers send individual emails with new feature ideas or modifications. Without a centralized system to track and approve these, the development team becomes overwhelmed, and the project falls behind schedule with an ever-growing list of unprioritized features. This problem is a common pitfall in project management, especially in organizations that lack maturity in their software development lifecycle. It directly contributes to project failures, budget overruns, and team burnout, and is particularly challenging in legacy modernization efforts where the scope can be inherently fluid.
