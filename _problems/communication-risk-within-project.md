## Description

Communication risk within projects occurs when team members cannot effectively share information, understand each other's messages, or coordinate their activities. This includes unclear requirements, ambiguous technical discussions, missed messages, and assumptions that lead to misunderstandings. Poor internal project communication creates confusion about priorities, duplicated effort, and decisions based on incomplete or incorrect information.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members frequently ask for clarification on previously discussed topics
- Different team members have different understanding of the same requirements
- Important decisions are made without all relevant stakeholders being informed
- Messages and documentation are ambiguous or subject to multiple interpretations
- Team meetings frequently involve confusion about what was previously agreed upon

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** Poor coordination leads to conflicting work and missed dependencies
- **[Duplicated Research Effort](duplicated-research-effort.md):** Multiple team members work on the same problems due to poor communication
- **[Implementation Rework](implementation-rework.md):** Work must be redone because of misunderstood requirements
- **[Delayed Decision Making](delayed-decision-making.md):** Decisions are postponed due to unclear information or miscommunication
- **Reduced Team Trust:** Team members lose confidence in each other due to communication failures

## Root Causes ▼

- **Unclear Communication Channels:** Team doesn't know how or when to communicate different types of information
- **Information Overload:** Too much communication makes it difficult to identify important messages
- **[Assumption-Based Development](assumption-based-development.md):** Team members assume others understand context that hasn't been explicitly shared
- **Time Zone Differences:** Distributed teams struggle with synchronous communication
- **Technical Jargon:** Specialized language creates barriers between team members with different backgrounds

## Detection Methods ○

- **Communication Pattern Analysis:** Track frequency and effectiveness of different communication methods
- **Meeting Effectiveness Assessment:** Evaluate whether meetings result in clear understanding and decisions
- **Message Clarity Testing:** Review documentation and messages for ambiguity or confusion
- **Decision Traceability Review:** Assess whether team members understand how and why decisions were made
- **Team Understanding Surveys:** Regular check-ins about clarity of communication and shared understanding

## Examples

A development team receives requirements from the product owner that state "users should be able to search efficiently." The backend team interprets this as needing to optimize database queries, the frontend team focuses on user interface responsiveness, and the product owner actually meant users should be able to find results quickly regardless of technical implementation. Each team works on their interpretation for weeks before discovering the misalignment during a demo, requiring significant rework to create a cohesive solution. Another example involves a distributed team where developers in different time zones use email for all communication. A critical bug is reported via email, but the developer responsible doesn't see the message until the next day because it was buried among other emails. Meanwhile, other team members start working on the same bug because they assume no one is addressing it, leading to duplicated effort and confusion about which fix to use.
