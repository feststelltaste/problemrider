## Description

Rapid prototyping becoming production occurs when code initially written as a quick prototype, proof-of-concept, or experimental implementation gets deployed to production without being properly engineered for production use. Prototype code typically lacks proper error handling, testing, documentation, security considerations, and scalable architecture because it was designed to demonstrate feasibility rather than serve real users. When this code becomes production software, it creates significant technical debt and reliability issues.

## Indicators ⟡

- Production systems contain code with minimal error handling or validation
- Critical business functions run on code that was originally a "quick test"
- System architecture reflects prototype-level design decisions
- Code comments reference "TODO" items that were never addressed
- Performance and scalability were not considered in system design

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Spaghetti Code](spaghetti-code.md):** Prototype code often lacks proper structure and organization
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Production systems built on prototype foundations accumulate significant debt
- **[Inadequate Error Handling](inadequate-error-handling.md):** Prototype code typically has minimal error handling for edge cases
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Security considerations are often omitted from prototype code
- **Performance Issues:** Prototypes aren't optimized for production-level usage

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Pressure to deliver quickly prevents proper re-engineering of prototype code
- **Success of Prototype:** Successful demonstrations lead to immediate production deployment
- **[Project Resource Constraints](project-resource-constraints.md):** Insufficient resources to properly engineer production version
- **Misunderstanding of Prototype Purpose:** Stakeholders don't understand difference between prototype and production code
- **Incremental Deployment:** Prototype evolves gradually into production without recognition of the transition

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Quality Analysis:** Analyze production systems for prototype-level code characteristics
- **Architecture Review:** Assess whether system architecture reflects production requirements
- **Error Handling Assessment:** Evaluate robustness of error handling and edge case management
- **Security Audit:** Review security practices and vulnerability exposure
- **Performance Testing:** Test system behavior under production-level loads

## Examples

A development team creates a quick prototype to demonstrate a new customer reporting feature to stakeholders. The prototype uses hardcoded database connections, has no error handling, and pulls data with inefficient queries that work fine for the small test dataset. The demonstration is so successful that management demands the feature be deployed to production immediately. Rather than rebuilding the system properly, the team makes minimal changes to hide the most obvious problems and deploys the prototype code. In production, the system fails when it encounters real customer data that doesn't match the prototype assumptions, causes database performance issues due to inefficient queries, and provides no useful error messages when things go wrong. Another example involves a machine learning prototype that performs well on a small test dataset using a simple Python script. The business is excited by the results and wants to process all customer data through the model. The prototype script is deployed to production with minimal modifications, but it crashes when processing large datasets, has no logging or monitoring, and requires manual restarts when it fails. What started as a successful prototype becomes a maintenance nightmare that requires constant attention from developers.
