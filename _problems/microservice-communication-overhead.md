## Description

Microservice communication overhead occurs when the network communication between services becomes a significant source of latency and reliability issues. Excessive inter-service calls, chatty communication patterns, and inefficient protocols can degrade system performance and create cascading failure points in distributed architectures.

## Indicators ⟡

- High network latency between service calls
- Large number of inter-service API calls for single user operations
- Network bandwidth consumption significantly impacts application performance
- Service response times dominated by network communication time
- Frequent timeout errors in service-to-service communication

## Symptoms ▲

- **High Inter-Service Latency:** Network calls between services create significant delays
- **Chatty Communication Patterns:** Multiple round-trip calls required for single operations
- **Network Bandwidth Saturation:** Service communication consuming excessive network resources
- **Cascading Timeout Failures:** Network delays causing timeout cascades across services
- **Protocol Inefficiency:** Communication protocols adding unnecessary overhead

## Root Causes ▼

- **Fine-Grained Service Boundaries:** Services split too granularly requiring excessive communication
- **Synchronous Communication Overuse:** Using synchronous calls where asynchronous would be more appropriate
- **Inefficient Communication Protocols:** Using verbose protocols like JSON over HTTP for high-frequency calls
- **Lack of Data Locality:** Related data spread across multiple services requiring multiple calls
- **Poor API Design:** APIs requiring multiple round-trips to accomplish single business operations
- **Missing Communication Optimization:** No batching, caching, or connection pooling between services

## Detection Methods ○

- **Inter-Service Communication Monitoring:** Track frequency, latency, and volume of service-to-service calls
- **Network Performance Analysis:** Monitor network bandwidth usage and latency between services
- **Service Dependency Mapping:** Visualize communication patterns and identify chatty interactions
- **Protocol Efficiency Analysis:** Compare different communication protocols and formats
- **End-to-End Latency Tracing:** Trace request flows to identify communication bottlenecks

## Examples

An e-commerce checkout process requires 15 separate API calls across 8 different microservices: user service for authentication, inventory service for availability, pricing service for calculations, tax service for tax calculation, shipping service for rates, payment service for processing, notification service for emails, and order service for persistence. Each call adds 50ms of network latency, making total checkout time 750ms plus processing time. Redesigning the checkout flow with a dedicated checkout orchestration service that batches calls and caches frequently accessed data reduces the external API calls to 3 and improves checkout performance by 80%. Another example involves a social media feed service that makes individual API calls to fetch user profiles for each post author. A feed with 50 posts requires 50 separate user service calls, each taking 20ms, adding 1 second of latency just for profile data. Implementing batch profile fetching reduces this to a single 30ms call.
