## Description

Gradual performance degradation is the slow deterioration of application performance over time, often so subtle that it goes unnoticed until it becomes severe. Unlike sudden performance problems caused by specific changes, this degradation accumulates gradually due to resource leaks, inefficient algorithms that scale poorly with data growth, or the accumulation of technical debt that makes the system increasingly inefficient. This problem is particularly insidious because it develops slowly and may not be detected until user experience is significantly impacted.

## Indicators ⟡
- Application response times increase gradually over weeks or months
- Performance metrics show steady downward trends rather than sudden drops
- Users begin complaining about slowness but can't pinpoint when it started
- System resource usage (memory, CPU, disk) gradually increases over time
- Performance problems appear to correlate with system uptime or data volume

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Slow Application Performance](slow-application-performance.md):** Overall application responsiveness decreases over time
- **Increased Resource Usage:** Memory, CPU, or disk utilization gradually increases without corresponding functionality additions
- **User Complaints:** End users report that the application feels slower than it used to be
- **Longer Boot Times:** Application startup or page load times progressively increase
- **Intermittent Timeouts:** Operations that used to complete reliably begin timing out occasionally

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Memory Leaks](memory-leaks.md):** Unreleased memory gradually reduces available resources and increases garbage collection overhead
- **Inefficient Data Structures:** Poor choice of algorithms or data structures that don't scale well as data volume grows
- **Resource Accumulation:** Connections, file handles, or other resources that are opened but never properly closed
- **Database Growth Issues:** Inefficient queries or missing indexes that become problematic as data volume increases
- **Cache Pollution:** Caching systems that grow indefinitely without proper eviction policies
- **Log File Growth:** Excessive logging that consumes increasing disk space and I/O resources

## Detection Methods ○
- **Performance Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of response times, throughput, and resource usage over time
- **Trend Analysis:** Statistical analysis of performance metrics to identify gradual deterioration patterns
- **Resource Usage Tracking:** Monitor memory, CPU, and disk usage patterns over extended periods
- **Load Testing Over Time:** Regular performance tests to establish baseline and detect degradation
- **Application Profiling:** Periodic profiling to identify resource usage patterns and potential leaks

## Examples

An enterprise web application runs smoothly when first deployed, with page load times averaging 200ms. Over six months, users gradually notice the application becoming slower, but attribute it to network issues or increased usage. Performance monitoring reveals that average response times have crept up to 800ms. Investigation shows that a session management component has a memory leak—it creates session objects but never properly garbage collects them when sessions expire. After months of operation, the application server is spending 60% of its time in garbage collection, dramatically slowing all operations. Another example involves a data analytics platform where report generation times slowly increase from seconds to minutes over a year. The root cause is that the system accumulates temporary files during report generation but only cleans them up during server restarts. As temporary files accumulate, disk I/O becomes increasingly slow, affecting all operations.
