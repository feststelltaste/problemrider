## Description

Missing end-to-end tests occur when testing strategies focus on individual components or features without verifying complete user workflows from start to finish. End-to-end tests simulate real user interactions across the entire system, including user interfaces, business logic, databases, and external integrations. Without these tests, applications may work correctly at the component level but fail when users attempt to complete actual business processes, leading to critical workflow failures in production.

## Indicators ⟡
- Components work individually but complete user workflows fail
- Users report being unable to complete common tasks despite individual features working
- Bugs occur at the intersections of multiple features or systems
- Integration issues appear only when following complete user journeys
- Production issues that are difficult to reproduce in isolated testing environments

## Symptoms ▲
- **Workflow Interruptions:** Users cannot complete critical business processes despite individual features functioning
- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** Issues reach production because complete workflows aren't validated
- **User Experience Problems:** Friction in user journeys that wasn't caught during component-level testing
- **Business Process Failures:** Core business operations fail due to issues in multi-step workflows
- **Customer Complaints:** Users frustrated by inability to accomplish their goals despite system appearing to work

## Root Causes ▼
- **Component-Focused Testing:** Testing strategy emphasizes individual features rather than complete user experiences
- **Complex Test Setup:** End-to-end tests are difficult to create and maintain due to system complexity
- **Slow Test Execution:** End-to-end tests take too long to run, discouraging their use in regular testing cycles
- **Environment Dependencies:** Tests require complex environment setup with databases, external services, and configurations
- **Lack of Test Data Management:** Difficulty creating and maintaining realistic test data for complete workflows
- **Testing Tool Limitations:** Inadequate tools for automating complex user interactions across multiple interfaces

## Detection Methods ○
- **User Journey Mapping:** Document complete user workflows and assess test coverage for each journey
- **Production Issue Analysis:** Track bugs that span multiple system components or user workflow steps
- **User Feedback Analysis:** Monitor customer reports about inability to complete tasks
- **Workflow Success Rate Monitoring:** Track completion rates for critical business processes in production
- **Cross-System Bug Detection:** Identify issues that occur only when multiple components interact in sequence

## Examples

An e-commerce platform has comprehensive unit tests for product catalog, shopping cart, payment processing, and order management components. Each component works perfectly in isolation and passes all individual tests. However, there are no end-to-end tests that verify complete purchasing workflows. In production, users discover that they can add items to their cart and proceed to checkout, but when they complete payment processing, their order is created with incorrect shipping addresses because the address validation component expects data in a different format than the payment component provides. The order appears successful to the user, but fulfillment fails because shipping addresses are invalid. This workflow-breaking bug wasn't caught because no tests verified the complete purchase process from product selection through successful order fulfillment. Another example involves a banking application where individual features like account balance checking, fund transfers, and transaction history all work correctly. However, end-to-end testing is missing for the complete "transfer money between accounts" workflow. In production, users can initiate transfers and receive confirmation messages, but due to a race condition between the debit and credit operations, some transfers result in money being debited from the source account without being credited to the destination account. The issue only occurs under specific timing conditions that arise in the complete workflow but never during isolated component testing.
