## Description

Implementation rework occurs when completed features or system components must be significantly rebuilt or reimplemented because the initial understanding of requirements, technical constraints, or system behavior was incorrect. This rework represents wasted development effort and extends project timelines, often frustrating both developers and stakeholders. Unlike normal iterative refinement, implementation rework involves fundamental changes that could have been avoided with better initial understanding or requirements analysis.

## Indicators ⟡

- Features are frequently rebuilt from scratch rather than incrementally improved
- Completed work is discarded due to incorrect assumptions about requirements
- Technical implementations fail integration testing due to misunderstood constraints
- Stakeholders reject completed features because they don't meet actual needs
- Development estimates consistently underestimate the need for rework

## Symptoms ▲

- **Wasted Development Effort:** Significant time spent on implementations that are ultimately discarded
- **Extended Project Timelines:** Projects take much longer due to multiple implementation iterations
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team morale suffers when work must be repeatedly redone
- **Budget Overruns:** Projects exceed budget due to unplanned rework effort
- **Stakeholder Dissatisfaction:** Business partners lose confidence in the development team's ability to deliver

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Insufficient understanding of business domain or technical requirements
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** Ambiguous or changing requirements lead to incorrect implementations
- **Inadequate Requirements Analysis:** Insufficient upfront investigation of constraints and dependencies
- **Communication Breakdown:** Misunderstandings between developers, stakeholders, and domain experts
- **[Extended Research Time](extended-research-time.md):** Pressure to start implementation before adequate research is complete
- **Assumption-Driven Development:** Developers proceed based on assumptions rather than verified understanding

## Detection Methods ○

- **Rework Tracking:** Monitor percentage of completed work that requires significant changes or rebuilding
- **Requirements Change Analysis:** Track how often requirements are clarified or corrected after implementation begins
- **Stakeholder Feedback Patterns:** Analyze feedback to identify recurring misunderstanding patterns
- **Implementation Cycle Analysis:** Measure how many iterations features require before acceptance
- **Developer Time Analysis:** Track time spent on rework vs. new development

## Examples

A development team spends three weeks implementing a customer reporting feature based on their understanding of the requirements, only to discover during user testing that the report format doesn't match regulatory compliance needs and must be completely redesigned. The team hadn't understood the complex regulatory context and built a feature that, while functionally correct, was unusable for its intended purpose. Another example involves a team implementing a performance optimization for a database query that they assumed was causing slowdowns, spending two weeks building a complex caching layer, only to discover through proper profiling that the actual bottleneck was in a completely different part of the system, making their optimization effort worthless.
