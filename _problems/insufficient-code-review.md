## Description

Insufficient code review occurs when the code review process fails to effectively identify and address design problems, potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, or maintainability issues before code reaches production. This can result from rushed reviews, lack of reviewer expertise, inadequate review guidelines, or cultural issues that discourage thorough feedback. Poor code review allows problematic code to accumulate, reducing overall system quality.

## Indicators ⟡

- Code reviews are completed very quickly without substantive feedback
- Reviews focus primarily on formatting and style rather than logic and design
- Complex changes receive the same level of review as trivial changes
- Reviewers approve code they don't fully understand
- Reviews are treated as a formality rather than a quality gate

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Spaghetti Code](spaghetti-code.md):** Poor structure and design patterns slip through inadequate reviews
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Problematic design decisions accumulate over time
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Security issues aren't caught during review process
- **[Difficult Code Comprehension](difficult-code-comprehension.md):** Unclear or complex code gets approved without improvement
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** Logic errors and edge cases aren't identified before deployment

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Pressure to complete reviews quickly prevents thorough analysis
- **[Reviewer Inexperience](reviewer-inexperience.md):** Reviewers lack expertise to identify complex problems
- **[Code Review Inefficiency](code-review-inefficiency.md):** No clear standards for what constitutes effective review
- **Review Fatigue:** Reviewers become tired or overwhelmed by excessive review workload
- **Cultural Issues:** Team culture discourages critical feedback or thorough review

## Detection Methods ○

- **Review Depth Analysis:** Measure time spent on reviews relative to code complexity
- **Issue Discovery Rate:** Track how many problems are found in production versus during review
- **Review Comment Quality:** Analyze types and depth of feedback provided in reviews
- **Reviewer Expertise Assessment:** Evaluate whether reviewers have appropriate knowledge for the code being reviewed
- **Post-Review Bug Correlation:** Compare bug rates for thoroughly reviewed versus lightly reviewed code

## Examples

A development team conducts code reviews but reviewers typically spend only 5-10 minutes reviewing complex changes involving hundreds of lines of code. Reviews focus on obvious syntax errors and formatting issues while missing architectural problems, inefficient algorithms, and potential security vulnerabilities. A complex authentication module passes review despite having a subtle logic flaw that allows unauthorized access under specific conditions. The vulnerability isn't discovered until security testing reveals the issue weeks later, requiring emergency fixes and security patches. Another example involves a team where senior developers are too busy to conduct thorough reviews, so junior developers review each other's code without sufficient expertise to identify design problems. A performance-critical module is approved despite using inefficient data structures and algorithms that cause significant slowdowns in production. The performance problems aren't discovered until the system is under heavy load, requiring extensive refactoring that could have been avoided with more experienced review.
