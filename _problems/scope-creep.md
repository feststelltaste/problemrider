## Description

Scope creep is the insidious expansion of a project's goals and deliverables beyond what was originally planned, without a corresponding adjustment in time, budget, or resources. It often happens gradually, through a series of seemingly small additions or changes that, over time, significantly bloat the project. This uncontrolled growth can derail timelines, exhaust budgets, and lead to a product that is unfocused and overly complex. The expansion can result from evolving business needs, stakeholder requests, discovered complexity, or poor initial requirement definition. Unlike controlled scope changes, scope creep happens gradually and often without formal recognition or planning adjustments. Effective project management requires vigilance against scope creep and a formal process for managing any proposed changes.

## Indicators ⟡

- The project's scope is constantly expanding
- Original project requirements are significantly different from final deliverables
- Development teams work on features that weren't in the original specification
- Project timelines stretch far beyond original estimates without formal scope change processes
- The team is frequently missing deadlines
- The team is constantly switching between different tasks and priorities
- Stakeholders continuously add "small" requests that accumulate into major changes
- Feature sets grow organically throughout development without impact assessment
- There is a lot of rework

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Constantly Shifting Deadlines](constantly-shifting-deadlines.md):** The project's end date is repeatedly pushed back to accommodate new feature requests
- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Original timelines become impossible due to expanded requirements
- **[Budget Overruns](budget-overruns.md):** The project costs more than originally planned due to the extra work being done
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Teams feel pressure to deliver expanded scope within original timeframes
- **[Gold Plating](gold-plating.md):** Developers add unnecessary features or complexity because they believe it will impress the stakeholders, even if it was not requested
- **[Feature Bloat](feature-bloat.md):** The concept of a "Minimum Viable Product" is lost, and the project becomes a collection of loosely related features
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The development team is overworked and stressed from trying to keep up with the constant stream of new requests
- **Resource Strain:** Development capacity is exceeded by the actual scope of work required
- **Quality Compromises:** Expanded scope leads to shortcuts to meet original deadlines

## Root Causes ▼

- **Poor Initial Scope Definition:** The project started without a well-defined scope or a clear understanding of what was in and out of scope
- **[No Formal Change Control Process](no-formal-change-control-process.md):** There is no process for evaluating new requests, assessing their impact, and getting formal approval before they are added to the project plan
- **[Change Management Chaos](change-management-chaos.md):** Poor change control processes allow uncontrolled expansion
- **[Eager to Please Stakeholders](eager-to-please-stakeholders.md):** The project team agrees to every new request from the stakeholders without pushing back or explaining the trade-offs
- **[Product Direction Chaos](product-direction-chaos.md):** There is no single person who is responsible for managing the product backlog and protecting the team from scope creep
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** The team does not have a clear understanding of the business goals of the project, so they are unable to distinguish between essential and non-essential features
- **Underestimated Complexity:** Original scope didn't account for actual system complexity
- **Evolving Business Needs:** Business requirements change during development without process adjustments
- **Gold Plating:** Developers add features beyond requirements without proper approval

## Detection Methods ○

- **Track Change Requests:** Keep a log of all new feature requests and changes to existing requirements
- **Scope Change Tracking:** Monitor additions and modifications to original project requirements
- **Timeline vs. Scope Analysis:** Compare original scope and timeline with actual deliverables and duration
- **Compare Plan vs. Actuals:** Regularly compare the project's progress against the original plan to see how much the scope has changed
- **Velocity Tracking:** In an agile team, a decrease in velocity can be a sign that the team is being burdened with unplanned work (see [Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md))
- **Feature Request Analysis:** Track informal feature requests and their impact on project scope
- **Effort Variance Tracking:** Monitor actual effort compared to original estimates
- **Stakeholder Request Patterns:** Analyze frequency and nature of additional requests from stakeholders
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** If stakeholders are constantly asking "Is it done yet?", it may be a sign that their expectations are not aligned with the project's reality

## Examples

A team is building a simple internal dashboard for the sales team. Initially, the only requirement is to display a list of customers. Then, a stakeholder asks if they can also see the total revenue for each customer. Then, another stakeholder asks for a chart of revenue over time. Soon, the simple dashboard has become a complex business intelligence tool, and the project is months behind schedule. In another case, a project is in its final week of development. A senior executive sees a demo and says, "This is great, but it would be perfect if we could just add one more thing..." The team, wanting to please the executive, agrees to the change, which ends up delaying the launch by a month.

A customer portal project originally scoped for basic account viewing and password reset grows to include advanced reporting, document upload, payment processing, and mobile optimization when stakeholders see early prototypes and request additional functionality. The original 3-month timeline becomes 8 months, but the deadline pressure remains because the launch was tied to a marketing campaign. Another example involves an internal tool project where the initial requirement for simple data entry expands to include workflow management, approval processes, integration with five external systems, and custom reporting when different departments see the potential and request their own features to be included. This is a very common problem in software projects, and it is one of the main reasons why they fail. It is especially prevalent in organizations that have a weak project management discipline.
