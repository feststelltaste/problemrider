## Description

Inconsistent coding standards occur when different parts of a codebase follow different formatting, naming, and structural conventions, making the code difficult to read, understand, and maintain. This inconsistency can arise from multiple developers working without agreed-upon standards, legacy code written with different conventions, or lack of automated enforcement of coding standards.

## Indicators ⟡

- Different naming conventions used throughout the codebase
- Inconsistent code formatting and indentation styles
- Mixed coding patterns and architectural approaches
- Different error handling approaches across components
- Varying levels of documentation and commenting

## Symptoms ▲

- **Mixed Naming Conventions:** camelCase, snake_case, and PascalCase used inconsistently
- **Formatting Inconsistencies:** Different indentation, bracket placement, and spacing styles
- **Pattern Variability:** Different architectural patterns used for similar functionality
- **Documentation Gaps:** Some components well-documented while others have no documentation
- **Code Review Friction:** Significant time spent on style issues rather than logic

## Root Causes ▼

- **Lack of Established Standards:** No defined coding standards or style guides for the project
- **Multiple Developer Backgrounds:** Developers from different backgrounds bringing different conventions
- **Legacy Code Integration:** Older code written with different standards mixed with new code
- **Missing Automated Enforcement:** No linters, formatters, or automated tools to enforce standards
- **Inadequate Code Review Process:** Code reviews not focusing on consistency and standards
- **Time Pressure Compromises:** Rushing development without attention to coding standards

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Style Analysis:** Use automated tools to detect formatting and style inconsistencies
- **Naming Convention Auditing:** Review codebase for consistent naming patterns
- **Code Review Quality Metrics:** Track time spent on style vs logic issues in code reviews
- **Developer Feedback Analysis:** Gather feedback on code readability and consistency issues
- **Codebase Health Metrics:** Measure code quality metrics across different parts of codebase

## Examples

A web application codebase has components written by different developers over time, resulting in a mix of naming conventions: some files use camelCase (`getUserData`), others use snake_case (`get_user_data`), and some use PascalCase (`GetUserData`). Database access is handled differently across modules - some use direct SQL queries, others use ORM methods, and some use stored procedures. Error handling varies from try-catch blocks to callback-based error handling to promise rejections. New developers spend significant time understanding these different patterns instead of focusing on business logic. Another example involves a Python project where some modules follow PEP 8 standards with 4-space indentation and snake_case naming, while other modules use 2-space indentation and camelCase naming. Some functions have comprehensive docstrings while others have no documentation, making the codebase difficult to navigate and maintain.
