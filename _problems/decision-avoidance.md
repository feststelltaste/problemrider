## Description

Decision avoidance occurs when development teams consistently postpone or defer making important technical decisions that are necessary for progress. This avoidance can stem from fear of making wrong choices, lack of clear decision-making authority, or excessive perfectionism about having complete information. The result is projects that stall while waiting for decisions, accumulated decision debt that becomes harder to resolve over time, and frustrated team members who cannot proceed with their work.

## Indicators ⟡

- Important technical decisions remain unmade for weeks or months
- Team meetings frequently end without resolving key decisions
- Multiple alternatives are continuously evaluated without selection
- Development work is blocked waiting for architectural or design decisions
- Decision-making responsibility is unclear or constantly deferred to others

## Symptoms ▲

- **Development Bottlenecks:** Progress stalls while waiting for necessary decisions
- **[Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md):** Teams continue analyzing options instead of making choices
- **Accumulated Decision Debt:** Deferred decisions create compound complexity for future choices
- **Team Frustration:** Developers become frustrated with inability to make progress
- **Inconsistent Implementation:** Without clear decisions, different team members make conflicting choices

## Root Causes ▼

- **Fear of Wrong Decisions:** Concern that making a suboptimal choice will create long-term problems
- **Lack of Decision Authority:** Unclear who has the authority or responsibility to make specific decisions
- **[Perfectionist Culture](perfectionist-culture.md):** Belief that all information must be gathered before deciding
- **Risk Aversion:** Excessive caution about potential negative consequences of decisions
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** Without clear objectives, it's difficult to evaluate decision criteria
- **Information Overwhelm:** Too many options or factors make decision-making feel impossible

## Detection Methods ○

- **Decision Log Tracking:** Monitor how long important decisions remain unresolved
- **Meeting Outcome Analysis:** Track what percentage of decision-focused meetings result in actual decisions
- **Blocked Work Analysis:** Measure how much development work is blocked waiting for decisions
- **Decision Quality Assessment:** Evaluate the impact and effectiveness of decisions that are eventually made
- **Team Surveys:** Ask about frustration with decision-making processes and bottlenecks

## Examples

A development team spends three months debating whether to use microservices or a modular monolith architecture for their new application. Multiple proof-of-concepts are built, extensive documentation is created comparing the approaches, and weekly meetings are held to discuss the decision, but no choice is made because the team wants to be "absolutely certain" they're making the right choice. Meanwhile, feature development cannot proceed without the architectural foundation, causing the project to fall months behind schedule. Another example involves a team that cannot decide on a frontend framework for six weeks, continuously researching new options and worrying about making a choice that might become obsolete, while user interface development remains completely blocked and stakeholder frustration grows.
