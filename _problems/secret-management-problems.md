## Description

Secret management problems occur when applications improperly handle sensitive information like passwords, API keys, certificates, and tokens. Poor secret management practices can lead to credential exposure, security breaches, and operational difficulties when secrets need to be rotated or updated across multiple systems and environments.

## Indicators ⟡

- Secrets hardcoded in source code or configuration files
- Credentials stored in plain text or easily accessible locations
- Same secrets used across multiple environments or applications
- No process for regularly rotating or updating secrets
- Secrets transmitted or logged in plain text

## Symptoms ▲

- **Hardcoded Credentials:** Passwords and API keys embedded directly in source code
- **Plain Text Secret Storage:** Secrets stored without encryption in configuration files or databases
- **Secret Sprawl:** Same credentials duplicated across multiple systems and locations
- **Rotation Difficulties:** Inability to easily update secrets across all systems that use them
- **Accidental Secret Exposure:** Secrets inadvertently exposed in logs, error messages, or version control

## Root Causes ▼

- **Lack of Secret Management System:** No centralized system for storing and managing secrets
- **Developer Convenience Practices:** Hardcoding secrets for ease of development
- **Insufficient Security Awareness:** Developers not understanding secret management best practices
- **Legacy System Constraints:** Older systems unable to integrate with modern secret management
- **Complex Secret Distribution:** Difficulty distributing secrets securely to all systems that need them
- **Inadequate Secret Lifecycle Management:** No processes for generating, rotating, and revoking secrets

## Detection Methods ○

- **Source Code Scanning:** Scan code repositories for hardcoded secrets and credentials
- **Configuration File Auditing:** Review configuration files for plain text secrets
- **Secret Usage Tracking:** Monitor where and how secrets are used across systems
- **Access Control Analysis:** Review who has access to secrets and secret management systems
- **Secret Rotation Testing:** Test secret rotation processes and impact on dependent systems

## Examples

A development team hardcodes database passwords directly in application configuration files that are committed to version control. When the repository is made public or accessed by unauthorized users, all database credentials are exposed. The team discovers that the same hardcoded password is used across development, staging, and production databases, meaning a single credential compromise affects all environments. Another example involves an API integration where third-party service API keys are stored in plain text environment variables and logged during application startup for debugging purposes. The logs containing API keys are stored in centralized logging systems accessible to many employees, effectively giving widespread access to sensitive credentials that could be used to access external services.
