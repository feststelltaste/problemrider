## Description

Staff availability issues occur when projects cannot access the human resources needed to execute planned work effectively. This includes unfilled critical roles, key team members being allocated to multiple conflicting priorities, extended absences without adequate coverage, and insufficient capacity to handle both planned work and unexpected urgent tasks. These availability constraints create bottlenecks that delay progress and force remaining team members to work beyond their sustainable capacity.

## Indicators ⟡

- Critical roles remain vacant for extended periods despite active recruitment
- Key team members are assigned to multiple high-priority projects simultaneously
- Team frequently delays work waiting for specific individuals to become available
- Important decisions are postponed because decision-makers are unavailable
- Team members consistently work overtime to compensate for insufficient staffing

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md):** Progress is constrained by availability of specific individuals
- **[Delayed Project Timelines](delayed-project-timelines.md):** Projects fall behind schedule due to resource constraints
- **[Overworked Teams](overworked-teams.md):** Available staff work excessive hours to compensate for understaffing
- **[Reduced Feature Quality](reduced-feature-quality.md):** Quality suffers when insufficient resources are available for thorough work
- **[Knowledge Dependency](knowledge-dependency.md):** Critical knowledge is concentrated in unavailable individuals

## Root Causes ▼

- **Poor Resource Planning:** Inadequate planning for human resource needs and availability
- **[Competing Priorities](competing-priorities.md):** Multiple projects compete for the same limited resources
- **Recruitment Challenges:** Difficulty finding and hiring qualified candidates
- **Budget Constraints:** Insufficient budget to hire needed personnel
- **[Single Points of Failure](single-points-of-failure.md):** Over-reliance on specific individuals for critical functions

## Detection Methods ○

- **Resource Utilization Analysis:** Track allocation and availability of team members across projects
- **Bottleneck Identification:** Identify tasks that consistently wait for specific individuals
- **Overtime Tracking:** Monitor excessive working hours that indicate understaffing
- **Project Delay Analysis:** Correlate project delays with resource availability issues
- **Skills Gap Assessment:** Evaluate whether team has necessary skills and capacity

## Examples

A critical enterprise system upgrade project requires a database administrator with specific expertise in the legacy mainframe system. The company's only qualified DBA is simultaneously assigned to three other high-priority projects and is also responsible for all production database support. Work on the upgrade project can only progress when the DBA is available, creating a severe bottleneck. Other team members sit idle while waiting for database schema changes, and the project timeline extends from six months to over a year. Another example involves a mobile app development team that loses two senior developers to other companies during a critical product launch phase. Despite immediate recruitment efforts, finding replacements with the necessary skills takes four months. The remaining junior developers struggle with complex architectural decisions and advanced features, forcing the team to either delay the launch or release with reduced functionality. The stress of covering for missing team members leads to burnout and quality issues in the delivered product.
