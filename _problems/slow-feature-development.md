## Description
Slow feature development is the consistent inability of a development team to deliver new functionality in a timely manner. This is a common and frustrating problem for both developers and stakeholders. It is often a symptom of deeper issues within the codebase and the development process. When it takes months to deliver a feature that should have taken weeks, it is a clear sign that the team is being held back by a legacy of past decisions.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team consistently fails to meet its own estimates for feature delivery.
- Stakeholders are constantly asking for updates on the status of long-overdue features.
- The team's backlog is growing much faster than it is shrinking.
- There is a general sense of frustration and impatience from both the business and the development team.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** The business is unable to respond quickly to market changes and new opportunities.
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** The lack of new features and improvements can lead to a decline in user engagement, customer satisfaction, and revenue.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Developers become demoralized by their inability to make progress and deliver value.
## Symptoms ▲
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** The business is unable to respond quickly to market changes and new opportunities.
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** The lack of new features and improvements can lead to a decline in user engagement, customer satisfaction, and revenue.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Developers become demoralized by their inability to make progress and deliver value.
- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** The long delays between feature requests and delivery can lead to a disconnect between what the business needs and what the development team is building.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** The codebase is so complex and fragile that it is difficult and time-consuming to add new functionality.
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** The lack of automated tests and high coupling make it risky to make changes, which slows down the development process.
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** Developers have to spend a lot of time understanding the existing code before they can modify it.
- **Lack of a Shared Language:** Communication breakdowns between developers and stakeholders can lead to rework and delays.
- **[Long-Lived Feature Branches](long-lived-feature-branches.md):** The use of long-lived feature branches can lead to merge conflicts and integration problems, which can significantly delay the release of new features.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Cycle Time:** Measure the time it takes for a feature to go from idea to production. A long cycle time is a clear indicator of slow feature development.
- **Lead Time:** Measure the time it takes for a feature to be delivered after it has been requested. A long lead time is a sign that the team is not responsive to the needs of the business.
- **Throughput:** Measure the number of features that the team is able to deliver in a given period of time. A low throughput is a sign that the team is not productive.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Ask stakeholders about their satisfaction with the speed of feature delivery. Their feedback can be a valuable source of information.

## Examples
A company wants to add a new feature to its flagship product. The feature is relatively simple, but the development team estimates that it will take six months to implement. The reason for the long estimate is that the product is built on a legacy codebase that is difficult to understand and modify. The team has to spend a lot of time reverse-engineering the existing code and writing extensive tests to make sure that they don't break anything. As a result, the company misses a key market opportunity, and its competitors are able to launch a similar feature first.
