## Description

Deployment risk occurs when releasing software changes carries a high probability of causing system failure, data loss, or extended downtime with limited ability to quickly recover. This risk manifests when deployment processes make irreversible changes, lack tested recovery mechanisms, or require complex manual interventions that can fail. High deployment risk creates a cycle where teams deploy infrequently to minimize risk, but infrequent deployments make each release larger and riskier.

## Indicators ⟡

- Deployments require extensive planning and multiple team members
- Team schedules deployments for off-hours due to expected problems
- Database migrations or schema changes cause particular anxiety
- Recovery from deployment problems requires hours or manual intervention
- Deployments are postponed or avoided due to risk concerns

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Release Anxiety](release-anxiety.md):** Team experiences stress and apprehension about deployments
- **[System Outages](system-outages.md):** Deployments frequently cause system downtime or instability
- **[Complex Deployment Process](complex-deployment-process.md):** Deployment procedures are complicated and error-prone
- **[Long Release Cycles](long-release-cycles.md):** Releases happen infrequently due to risk concerns
- **Extended Problem Resolution:** Deployment problems take long time to diagnose and fix
- **[Data Migration Integrity Issues](data-migration-integrity-issues.md):** Deployments threaten data integrity or availability

## Root Causes ▼

- **Irreversible Changes:** Deployment processes make changes that are difficult or impossible to undo
- **Manual Deployment Steps:** Human intervention points create opportunities for error
- **Database Schema Coupling:** Application deployments require coordinated database changes
- **Environment Differences:** Deployment targets don't match development and testing environments
- **Large Batch Changes:** Infrequent deployments accumulate many changes, increasing complexity
- **Quality Blind Spots:** Deployment procedures aren't tested until production deployment
- **Recovery Planning Gaps:** No tested procedures for handling deployment failures

## Detection Methods ○

- **Deployment Success Rate:** Track percentage of deployments that complete without issues
- **Recovery Time Analysis:** Measure time required to resolve deployment problems
- **Deployment Frequency vs. Risk:** Analyze correlation between deployment frequency and problems
- **Rollback Capability Assessment:** Evaluate ability to quickly revert problematic deployments
- **Deployment Process Complexity:** Track number of manual steps and potential failure points
- **Team Stress Indicators:** Monitor team anxiety and overtime associated with deployments

## Examples

A financial services application requires database schema changes for each release, and these migrations can take several hours to complete during which the system is unavailable. If a migration fails partway through, the database is left in an inconsistent state that requires manual intervention by database administrators, potentially causing extended outages. The team deploys only once per month due to this risk, but monthly releases are large and complex, making failures more likely. Another example involves a microservices platform where deployments require coordinated updates across multiple services in a specific sequence. If any service fails to deploy correctly, the entire system can become unstable, but rolling back requires manually reverting each service in reverse order, a process that often introduces additional errors and extends the outage.
