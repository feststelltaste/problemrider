## Description

Excessive object allocation occurs when code creates an unnecessarily large number of temporary objects, particularly in frequently executed code paths. This puts pressure on the garbage collector, increases memory usage, and can significantly degrade application performance. While object creation is normal in object-oriented programming, excessive allocation in hot paths can cause performance problems that worsen as the application scales or processes more data.

## Indicators ⟡
- Garbage collection occurs frequently and consumes significant CPU time
- Memory usage spikes during normal operation even without memory leaks
- Application performance degrades during periods of high activity
- Profiling shows high object allocation rates in specific code areas
- Performance improves significantly when object pooling or reuse is implemented

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Gradual Performance Degradation](gradual-performance-degradation.md):** Performance worsens over time as garbage collection overhead increases
- **[Inefficient Code](inefficient-code.md):** Code consumes more resources than necessary due to excessive object creation
- **GC Pressure:** Frequent garbage collection pauses affect application responsiveness
- **Memory Churn:** High rates of memory allocation and deallocation without true memory leaks
- **Scalability Issues:** Performance problems become worse as application load increases

## Root Causes ▼
- **String Concatenation:** Creating many temporary string objects through repeated concatenation operations
- **Unnecessary Object Creation:** Creating objects within loops or frequently called methods when reuse would be appropriate
- **Boxing/Unboxing:** Automatic conversion between primitive types and wrapper objects in languages like Java or C#
- **Collection Operations:** Creating new collections or arrays when existing ones could be reused or modified
- **Poor Algorithm Choice:** Using algorithms that require creating many temporary objects instead of more efficient alternatives
- **Lack of Performance Awareness:** Developers unaware of the performance implications of object creation patterns

## Detection Methods ○
- **Memory Profiling:** Use profiling tools to identify code areas with high object allocation rates
- **Garbage Collection Monitoring:** Track GC frequency, duration, and memory pressure metrics
- **Allocation Rate Analysis:** Measure object creation rates in different parts of the application
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing that reveals allocation-related performance issues
- **Code Review Focus:** Specifically examine code for unnecessary object creation patterns

## Examples

A data processing application reads CSV files and processes each row by creating a new `DataRecord` object, then converting each field to appropriate types by creating additional temporary objects for validation and transformation. For a file with 1 million rows and 20 columns, this creates over 20 million temporary objects within a single processing operation. The excessive allocation causes the garbage collector to run continuously, consuming 60% of CPU time and making the processing 10 times slower than necessary. Refactoring to reuse objects and use primitive types where possible reduces processing time from 10 minutes to 1 minute. Another example involves a web application that builds JSON responses by repeatedly concatenating strings in a loop, creating thousands of temporary string objects for each API response. During high traffic periods, the server spends more time in garbage collection than processing actual requests. Users experience slow response times and the server requires more memory and CPU resources than similar applications. Switching to a StringBuilder or streaming JSON writer eliminates the performance problem and reduces server resource requirements by 70%.
