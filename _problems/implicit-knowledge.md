## Description

Implicit knowledge refers to critical information about system behavior, business rules, implementation decisions, and operational practices that exists only in the minds of experienced team members rather than being explicitly documented or captured in code. This knowledge includes unwritten assumptions, contextual understanding, historical decisions, and practical know-how that is essential for understanding and maintaining the system but is not formally recorded anywhere.

## Indicators ⟡

- Experienced developers can quickly solve problems that stump newcomers
- System behavior depends on unwritten rules and assumptions
- Critical knowledge is lost when experienced team members leave
- New hires ask many questions that aren't answered in existing documentation
- Certain system behaviors can only be explained by specific individuals

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical knowledge is concentrated in specific individuals
- **[Slow Knowledge Transfer](slow-knowledge-transfer.md):** New team members take excessive time to become productive
- **[Single Points of Failure](single-points-of-failure.md):** System understanding depends on specific people being available
- **[Inconsistent Execution](inconsistent-execution.md):** Different team members handle similar situations differently
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Problems are hard to solve without tribal knowledge

## Root Causes ▼

- **Time Pressure:** No time allocated for knowledge capture and documentation
- **Knowledge Tacitness:** Some knowledge is difficult to articulate or codify explicitly
- **Oral Tradition Culture:** Teams rely on verbal knowledge transfer rather than written documentation
- **Historical Context Loss:** Decisions were made without documenting the reasoning or context
- **Assumption Proliferation:** Unspoken assumptions accumulate over time without being made explicit

## Detection Methods ○

- **Knowledge Dependency Mapping:** Identify which team members are consulted for specific types of problems
- **New Hire Question Analysis:** Track the types and frequency of questions asked by new team members
- **Documentation Gap Assessment:** Compare system complexity with the comprehensiveness of written documentation
- **Expert Availability Impact:** Measure how system understanding suffers when key individuals are unavailable
- **Decision Archaeology:** Investigate how many system decisions lack documented rationale

## Examples

A legacy financial trading system has a configuration parameter that must be set to a specific value during market holidays, but this requirement exists nowhere in the documentation. Only the senior architect knows that this setting prevents a race condition that occurs when market data feeds are inconsistent during holiday schedules. When the architect goes on vacation and a junior developer deploys a configuration change, the system experiences data corruption issues that take days to identify and resolve. Another example involves an e-commerce platform where the order processing logic has subtle timing dependencies that require specific database queries to be executed in a particular sequence. This knowledge exists only in the heads of two senior developers who learned it through years of troubleshooting production issues. When the team tries to optimize the order processing code, they inadvertently break these timing assumptions and cause intermittent order failures that are extremely difficult to reproduce and debug.
