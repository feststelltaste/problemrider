## Description

Increased risk of bugs occurs when the structure, complexity, or clarity of code makes it more likely that developers will introduce defects during development or maintenance activities. This heightened risk stems from code that is difficult to understand, test, or modify safely. Unlike direct bug introduction, this problem focuses on the systematic factors that make bug introduction more probable, creating an environment where even careful developers are likely to make mistakes.

## Indicators ⟡
- Bug rates increase when certain modules or developers are involved
- Similar types of bugs are repeatedly introduced in the same areas of code
- Code reviews frequently catch potential bugs that developers missed
- Developers express uncertainty about the correctness of their changes
- Testing reveals bugs that should have been obvious during development

## Symptoms ▲
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** Overall defect rates increase due to systematic risk factors
- **[Regression Bugs](regression-bugs.md):** Changes frequently break existing functionality due to lack of understanding
- **Repeated Defect Patterns:** Similar bugs appear multiple times because root causes aren't addressed
- **Extended Testing Cycles:** More testing is required because code is more likely to contain defects
- **Developer Anxiety:** Team members lose confidence in their ability to make changes safely

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** Convoluted code is difficult to understand and modify correctly
- **[Inexperienced Developers](inexperienced-developers.md):** Lack of experience increases likelihood of making mistakes
- **Poor Code Structure:** Badly organized code makes it difficult to understand relationships and dependencies
- **Quality Blind Spots:** Lack of tests means bugs aren't caught before they reach production
- **Hidden Dependencies:** Unclear relationships between components make it easy to break things inadvertently
- **Time Pressure:** Rushed development increases the likelihood of mistakes and shortcuts

## Detection Methods ○
- **Bug Pattern Analysis:** Track which areas of code or types of changes are most likely to introduce bugs
- **Developer-Specific Metrics:** Monitor bug introduction rates by individual developers to identify training needs
- **Code Complexity Correlation:** Analyze relationship between code complexity metrics and bug density
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Track which types of changes are most likely to cause problems
- **Testing Effectiveness:** Measure how many bugs are caught during development vs. production

## Examples

A legacy inventory management system has a pricing calculation module with nested conditional logic that handles dozens of special cases for different product types, customer categories, and promotional discounts. The logic is spread across multiple functions with unclear naming and no documentation explaining the business rules. When developers need to add support for a new product category, they must navigate this complex logic to understand where to make changes. Due to the complexity, they frequently miss edge cases or misunderstand existing rules, introducing bugs where certain combinations of products and promotions produce incorrect prices. Despite careful code reviews, these bugs often go undetected because reviewers also struggle to understand all the interactions within the complex pricing logic. Another example involves a user authentication system where password validation, session management, and permission checking are intertwined in a single large class. When developers need to modify any authentication behavior, they must understand the entire class and its many responsibilities. The complexity makes it easy to accidentally break unrelated functionality, such as modifying password validation logic and inadvertently affecting session timeout behavior.
