## Description

Stagnant architecture occurs when a system's fundamental design and structure remain unchanged despite evolving business requirements, technological advances, and lessons learned from operational experience. This happens when teams consistently avoid architectural improvements due to perceived risks, time constraints, or complexity. The result is a system that becomes increasingly misaligned with current needs, making it difficult to implement new features efficiently or integrate with modern technologies.

## Indicators ⟡

- Core architectural patterns haven't changed in years despite new requirements
- New features feel "bolted on" rather than naturally integrated
- Developers frequently mention that "the system wasn't designed for this"
- Integration with new technologies requires extensive adapter layers
- The system architecture predates current business models or user patterns

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Architectural Mismatch](architectural-mismatch.md):** New business requirements don't fit well within existing architectural constraints
- **[Complex Deployment Process](complex-deployment-process.md):** Outdated deployment patterns complicate modern DevOps practices
- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** Connecting with modern services requires extensive workarounds
- **[Slow Feature Development](slow-feature-development.md):** New features take disproportionate effort due to architectural limitations
- **[Technology Isolation](technology-isolation.md):** The system becomes increasingly isolated from modern technology stacks

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Teams avoid major architectural changes due to perceived risks
- **[Obsolete Technologies](obsolete-technologies.md):** Legacy technology choices constrain architectural evolution
- **[Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md):** No long-term plan for system evolution
- **Resource Constraints:** Architectural improvements are seen as non-essential compared to feature development
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Team lacks expertise in modern architectural patterns
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Short-term feature delivery takes priority over long-term architectural health

## Detection Methods ○

- **Architecture Review Sessions:** Regular assessment of how well current architecture serves business needs
- **Technology Stack Analysis:** Compare current stack with industry standards and modern alternatives
- **Feature Development Time Tracking:** Monitor whether similar features take increasing amounts of time
- **Integration Complexity Metrics:** Measure effort required to integrate with new systems or services
- **Developer Feedback:** Survey team about architectural pain points and limitations

## Examples

An e-commerce platform built 8 years ago using a traditional three-tier architecture struggles to implement modern features like real-time inventory updates, personalized recommendations, and mobile-first user experiences. The monolithic design makes it difficult to scale individual components, implement microservices for new functionality, or adopt event-driven patterns. New features like social media integration require extensive workarounds because the original architecture assumed all user interactions would happen through the web interface. Another example involves a financial services application where the original client-server architecture prevents implementation of modern security patterns, real-time fraud detection, and cloud-native deployment strategies, forcing the team to layer increasingly complex solutions on top of the inflexible foundation.
