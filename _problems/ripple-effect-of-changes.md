## Description

Ripple effect of changes occurs when modifying one component necessitates changes in numerous other components throughout the system, even when those components should logically be independent. This indicates excessive coupling between system parts and poor separation of concerns. The ripple effect makes simple changes expensive and risky, as developers must modify and test multiple areas of the codebase for what should be isolated changes.

## Indicators ⟡
- Simple feature changes require modifications across multiple modules or layers
- Bug fixes in one area break functionality in unrelated areas
- Adding new functionality requires understanding and modifying large portions of the codebase
- Developers regularly say "if we change this, we also need to change X, Y, and Z"
- Impact analysis for changes consistently reveals more affected components than expected

## Symptoms ▲
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Components are tightly interconnected, making changes propagate widely
- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Developers become reluctant to make modifications due to widespread impact
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** The system becomes fragile as changes in one area can break seemingly unrelated functionality
- **Extended Development Time:** Simple changes take much longer than expected due to the need to modify multiple components
- **Increased Testing Burden:** Every change requires testing across many system areas to ensure nothing breaks

## Root Causes ▼
- **Tight Coupling:** Components depend directly on implementation details of other components rather than abstractions
- **Shared Data Structures:** Multiple components rely on the same data structures, so changes to the structure affect all consumers
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns:** Aspects like logging, security, or validation are embedded throughout the codebase rather than abstracted
- **Poor Abstraction Layers:** Lack of proper interfaces and abstraction boundaries between system components
- **Violation of Single Responsibility:** Components handle multiple concerns, creating dependencies across different functional areas
- **Direct Dependencies:** Components instantiate or directly reference other concrete classes rather than using dependency injection

## Detection Methods ○
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Track how many files or modules need modification for typical changes
- **Dependency Analysis Tools:** Use static analysis to visualize and measure coupling between components
- **Change Frequency Correlation:** Identify components that frequently change together, indicating coupling
- **Developer Feedback:** Ask developers about the typical scope of changes they need to make
- **Code Review Patterns:** Monitor how often reviews involve discussions about widespread changes

## Examples

An e-commerce system needs to add support for a new payment method. What should be a simple addition to the payment processing module instead requires changes to: the order validation logic (which hardcodes payment types), the user interface (which has payment-specific display logic scattered throughout), the reporting system (which directly queries payment tables), the email notification system (which has payment-specific templates), and the inventory management system (which has different reservation logic for different payment types). A change that should take a few hours ends up requiring two weeks of development and extensive regression testing across the entire application. Another example involves a content management system where adding a new field to user profiles requires modifications to the database schema, user interface components, validation logic, search indexing, export functionality, user migration scripts, API endpoints, mobile app synchronization, and third-party integrations. The ripple effect makes what should be a simple database change into a complex project involving multiple teams and systems.
