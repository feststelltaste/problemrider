## Description

Integration difficulties arise when systems cannot easily connect with external services, modern APIs, or new technology components due to architectural limitations, outdated protocols, or incompatible data formats. This problem becomes increasingly common as business needs require integration with cloud services, third-party APIs, modern authentication systems, or real-time data streams that weren't anticipated in the original system design. The result is complex adapter layers, brittle integration code, and reduced system capabilities.

## Indicators ⟡

- Integration projects consistently take much longer than estimated
- Simple integrations require complex adapter or translation layers
- New service integrations break existing functionality
- Team avoids integrating with modern services due to technical barriers
- Integration code is significantly more complex than the business logic it supports

## Symptoms ▲

- **Complex Adapter Layers:** Extensive code required to bridge between different system architectures
- **Brittle Integration Code:** Integration points are fragile and prone to breaking with minor changes
- **Limited Technology Adoption:** Unable to leverage modern services and technologies effectively
- **Data Synchronization Issues:** Difficulty maintaining consistent data across integrated systems
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Integration overhead creates system performance problems

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Stagnant Architecture](stagnant-architecture.md):** System architecture hasn't evolved to support modern integration patterns
- **[Obsolete Technologies](obsolete-technologies.md):** Legacy technology stack is incompatible with modern integration standards
- **Protocol Mismatches:** System uses outdated communication protocols that don't align with modern APIs
- **Data Format Incompatibilities:** Legacy data formats don't map well to modern service interfaces
- **Authentication Limitations:** Existing authentication systems can't support modern security protocols
- **[Architectural Mismatch](architectural-mismatch.md):** Fundamental architectural patterns conflict with integration requirements

## Detection Methods ○

- **Integration Time Tracking:** Monitor time required for integration projects vs. business value delivered
- **Adapter Code Analysis:** Measure the complexity and volume of integration adapter code
- **Integration Failure Metrics:** Track frequency of integration-related system failures
- **Technology Stack Assessment:** Compare current integration capabilities with industry standards
- **Service Compatibility Analysis:** Evaluate how well the system can integrate with target modern services

## Examples

A legacy customer relationship management system built with SOAP web services struggles to integrate with modern REST APIs and OAuth 2.0 authentication. Each new integration requires building custom adapter services that translate between SOAP and REST, handle authentication token management, and convert between XML and JSON data formats. A simple integration with a modern email marketing service that should take days instead takes weeks due to the architectural impedance mismatch. Another example involves a financial system that uses proprietary binary protocols for internal communication, making it extremely difficult to integrate with cloud-based analytics services that expect standard HTTP APIs and JSON data formats. The team must build and maintain complex middleware that translates between the proprietary format and standard protocols, creating additional failure points and maintenance overhead.
