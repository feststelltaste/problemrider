## Description

Password security weaknesses occur when systems implement inadequate password policies, use insecure storage methods, or have poor password management practices. These vulnerabilities make user accounts susceptible to brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, credential stuffing, and unauthorized access through compromised or weak passwords.

## Indicators ⟡

- Systems allow weak or easily guessable passwords
- Passwords stored in plain text or using weak hashing algorithms
- No account lockout mechanisms for failed login attempts
- Password reset processes that are easily exploitable
- Default or shared passwords used across systems or accounts

## Symptoms ▲

- **Weak Password Acceptance:** System accepts passwords that are easily guessable or commonly used
- **Insecure Password Storage:** Passwords stored without proper hashing or using weak encryption
- **Brute Force Vulnerability:** No protection against automated password guessing attacks
- **Password Reset Exploitation:** Password reset mechanisms that can be easily abused
- **Credential Reuse Issues:** Users able to reuse old passwords or use same password across systems

## Root Causes ▼

- **Inadequate Password Policies:** No minimum complexity requirements or insufficient password strength validation
- **Weak Hashing Algorithms:** Using MD5, SHA1, or other cryptographically weak hashing methods
- **Missing Salt Usage:** Password hashes not salted, making them vulnerable to rainbow table attacks
- **Insufficient Rate Limiting:** No protection against brute force or credential stuffing attacks
- **Poor Password Reset Implementation:** Insecure password reset tokens or processes
- **Default Credential Usage:** Systems shipped with default passwords that are never changed

## Detection Methods ○

- **Password Policy Analysis:** Review password requirements and enforcement mechanisms
- **Password Storage Audit:** Examine how passwords are hashed and stored in databases
- **Brute Force Testing:** Test system resistance to automated password attacks
- **Password Reset Security Testing:** Analyze password reset process for vulnerabilities
- **Default Credential Scanning:** Check for systems using default or common passwords

## Examples

A web application stores user passwords using MD5 hashing without salt. When the database is compromised, attackers use rainbow tables to quickly reverse the MD5 hashes and recover original passwords for most users. The application also allows passwords as simple as "123456" and doesn't implement any account lockout after failed login attempts, making brute force attacks trivial. Another example involves a corporate system that ships with default administrator credentials "admin/admin" and many installations never change these defaults. Attackers use automated scanners to find systems with default credentials and gain administrative access. The password reset functionality sends new passwords via email in plain text, creating another vulnerability where email interception can compromise accounts.
