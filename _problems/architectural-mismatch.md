## Description

Architectural mismatch occurs when the current system architecture is fundamentally incompatible with new business requirements, user patterns, or technical needs. This mismatch forces developers to create complex workarounds, implement suboptimal solutions, or make significant compromises that undermine the effectiveness of new features. The root cause is typically that the original architecture was designed for different assumptions about scale, usage patterns, or business models that no longer apply.

## Indicators ⟡

- New features require extensive workarounds that don't align with the existing architecture
- Implementing standard functionality becomes disproportionately complex
- Team frequently discusses how "the system wasn't designed for this"
- New requirements force violation of established architectural principles
- Features that should be simple become multi-month projects due to architectural constraints

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Complex Implementation Paths](complex-implementation-paths.md):** Simple business requirements require complex technical solutions
- **[Accumulation of Workarounds](accumulation-of-workarounds.md):** New features are implemented as patches rather than natural extensions
- **[Slow Application Performance](slow-application-performance.md):** Architecture can't efficiently support new usage patterns or scale requirements
- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** New systems or services can't integrate cleanly with existing architecture
- **[Slow Feature Development](slow-feature-development.md):** Development velocity decreases as architectural friction increases

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Stagnant Architecture](stagnant-architecture.md):** System design hasn't evolved to meet changing business needs
- **Changed Business Model:** Original architecture was designed for different business assumptions
- **[Scaling Inefficiencies](scaling-inefficiencies.md):** System has grown beyond the scale the architecture was designed to handle
- **[Technology Lock-In](technology-lock-in.md):** Business needs require technologies incompatible with current architecture
- **User Pattern Evolution:** Users interact with the system in ways not anticipated by the original design
- **[Obsolete Technologies](obsolete-technologies.md):** Legacy technology choices constrain architectural options

## Detection Methods ○

- **Feature Complexity Analysis:** Compare implementation complexity of new features vs. historical norms
- **Architecture Review Sessions:** Regular assessment of how well architecture serves current business needs
- **Developer Feedback:** Survey team about architectural pain points and implementation challenges
- **Requirements vs. Architecture Mapping:** Analyze how well new requirements align with architectural capabilities
- **Implementation Time Tracking:** Monitor whether similar features take increasing amounts of time to implement

## Examples

An e-commerce platform originally designed for a catalog of 1,000 products now needs to support 100,000 products with real-time inventory tracking and personalized recommendations. The original three-tier architecture with a monolithic database can't efficiently handle the data volume and complex queries required, forcing the team to implement elaborate caching layers, denormalization strategies, and background synchronization processes that add complexity without solving the fundamental scale mismatch. Another example involves a content management system designed for publishing articles that now needs to support interactive widgets, real-time collaboration, and multimedia content. The document-centric architecture makes it extremely difficult to implement these features naturally, requiring complex workarounds that compromise both performance and user experience.
