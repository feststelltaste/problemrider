## Description

Silent data corruption occurs when data becomes altered, damaged, or lost without the system detecting or reporting the corruption. Unlike explicit errors that trigger exceptions or alerts, silent corruption allows corrupted data to persist in the system, potentially propagating through other processes and creating compounding problems. This corruption can happen at various levels including storage, transmission, processing, or during data transformations.

## Indicators ⟡

- Calculated results or reports show unexpected variations without clear cause
- Data appears to change between reads without any intervening write operations
- Checksums or validation routines are missing from critical data processing paths
- Systems lack comprehensive data integrity monitoring and alerting
- Data transformations occur without proper validation of input and output
- Historical data shows inconsistencies when compared across time periods

## Symptoms ▲

- **Incorrect Business Decisions:** Reports and analytics show wrong data leading to poor decisions
- **[Data Migration Integrity Issues](data-migration-integrity-issues.md):** Corruption discovered during migration processes reveals existing problems
- **Customer Trust Erosion:** Customers receive incorrect bills, statements, or account information
- **Regulatory Compliance Violations:** Corrupted records create compliance issues with audit trails
- **System Reliability Degradation:** Applications make incorrect decisions based on corrupted data
- **Financial Losses:** Incorrect calculations lead to revenue loss or regulatory penalties

## Causes ▼

- **[Inadequate Error Handling](inadequate-error-handling.md):** Systems fail silently without reporting data processing errors
- **Missing Data Validation:** No validation checks during data input, processing, or storage operations
- **Hardware Failures:** Storage device degradation, memory errors, or network transmission issues
- **Software Bugs:** Programming errors in data processing logic that alter data unexpectedly
- **Concurrent Access Issues:** Race conditions or improper locking during data modifications
- **Legacy System Integration:** Data format mismatches during system integration causing silent transformation errors

## Detection Methods ○

- **Data Integrity Checksums:** Implement and regularly verify checksums for critical data
- **End-to-End Validation:** Compare input data with final output to detect transformation errors
- **Data Quality Monitoring:** Automated monitoring for data anomalies, outliers, and inconsistencies
- **Audit Trail Analysis:** Regular review of data modification logs for unexpected changes
- **Cross-System Validation:** Compare data across redundant systems or backups
- **Statistical Analysis:** Monitor data distributions and patterns to detect anomalies
- **Regular Data Audits:** Systematic review of critical data sets for corruption indicators

## Examples

A financial system processes thousands of transactions daily, but due to a subtle bug in floating-point arithmetic, amounts are occasionally rounded incorrectly by tiny fractions. Over months, these micro-errors accumulate into significant discrepancies in account balances, but no error is ever reported because the individual rounding errors are within expected precision limits. The corruption is only discovered during an annual audit when customer accounts don't reconcile properly. Another example involves a customer database where encoding issues during data import silently truncate special characters in customer names and addresses. The system continues to function normally, but customers with non-ASCII characters in their names receive incorrectly addressed mail and their support requests become harder to track due to name mismatches. The corruption goes unnoticed until customers complain about delivery issues.
