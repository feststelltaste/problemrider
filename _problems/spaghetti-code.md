## Description

Spaghetti code refers to source code that has become tangled, unstructured, and difficult to follow due to poor organization, excessive use of control structures like goto statements, deeply nested conditionals, and lack of clear separation between different concerns. The code flow jumps around unpredictably, making it extremely difficult to understand the program logic, trace execution paths, or make changes without introducing bugs.

## Indicators ⟡

- Code execution flow is difficult to follow and jumps around unpredictably
- Functions or methods are extremely long with deeply nested control structures
- Global variables are used extensively for communication between different parts
- Code contains many arbitrary jumps, breaks, or continues that disrupt logical flow
- Multiple exit points from functions make it hard to understand return conditions

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Difficult Code Comprehension](difficult-code-comprehension.md):** Developers struggle to understand what the code does or how it works
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Tracing bugs through tangled code paths is extremely challenging
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** Changes frequently introduce unexpected side effects
- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Developers avoid modifying the code due to unpredictable consequences
- **[Extended Research Time](extended-research-time.md):** Simple changes require extensive analysis to understand impact

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Code written without considering overall organization or flow
- **[Rapid Prototyping Becoming Production](rapid-prototyping-becoming-production.md):** Quick prototype code that was never properly architected
- **Multiple Developer Modifications:** Many developers modifying code over time without refactoring
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Rush to deliver features without time for proper code organization
- **[Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md):** Poor review processes that don't catch structural problems

## Detection Methods ○

- **Cyclomatic Complexity Analysis:** Use tools to measure code complexity and identify tangled methods
- **Control Flow Visualization:** Create diagrams showing code execution paths to identify spaghetti patterns
- **Code Metrics Assessment:** Track function length, nesting depth, and number of exit points
- **Developer Feedback:** Survey team members about areas of code that are difficult to understand
- **Bug Density Analysis:** Identify code areas with high bug rates that may indicate spaghetti structure

## Examples

A legacy e-commerce system has a checkout process implemented as a single 2000-line function with 15 levels of nested if-statements, multiple goto statements jumping to different parts of the function, and global variables tracking state changes throughout the process. The function handles payment processing, inventory updates, shipping calculations, tax computation, and email notifications all in one tangled mess. When a bug is reported in the tax calculation, developers spend days tracing through the code to understand which path leads to the problem, and fixing it risks breaking payment processing or inventory management. Another example involves a reporting system where data processing logic is scattered across multiple functions that call each other in unpredictable ways, using global variables to pass data between different processing stages. A simple change to add a new data field requires understanding and modifying seven different functions, each with its own complex control flow and side effects.
