## Description

Poor project control occurs when project management lacks effective mechanisms to track progress, identify risks, and make necessary adjustments. This includes inadequate monitoring of milestones, poor visibility into actual versus planned progress, insufficient risk management, and delayed recognition of problems. Without proper control mechanisms, projects drift away from their intended course, and corrective action is taken too late to be effective.

## Indicators ⟡

- Project status reports are infrequent, superficial, or consistently optimistic
- Actual progress significantly differs from reported progress
- Problems are discovered late when they've become critical
- Project metrics focus on activity rather than outcomes
- Team members have different understanding of project status and priorities

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Project consistently fails to meet scheduled milestones
- **[Budget Overruns](budget-overruns.md):** Project costs exceed planned budget without early warning
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** Project scope expands without proper evaluation and approval
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** Team members work at cross-purposes due to poor coordination
- **[Stakeholder Confidence Loss](stakeholder-confidence-loss.md):** Stakeholders lose trust in project leadership and delivery capability

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Poor Planning](poor-planning.md):** Initial project plans lack sufficient detail and realistic estimates
- **Weak Progress Tracking:** No systematic approach to monitoring actual progress against plans
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Information about problems and risks doesn't reach decision-makers
- **Optimism Bias:** Tendency to underestimate problems and overestimate progress
- **Lack of Project Management Skills:** Project leaders lack training and experience in effective project control

## Detection Methods ○

- **Progress Variance Analysis:** Compare actual progress against planned milestones and budgets
- **Risk Register Review:** Assess whether risks are being identified and managed proactively
- **Communication Effectiveness Assessment:** Evaluate quality and frequency of project communication
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Gather feedback on project communication and progress visibility
- **Project Health Audits:** Regular independent assessment of project status and control mechanisms

## Examples

A software development project reports "90% complete" for several months running while the team privately acknowledges they're nowhere near done. The project manager focuses on tracking hours worked rather than features completed, and weekly status meetings consist mainly of optimistic updates without discussing blockers or risks. When stakeholders finally demand a demonstration, they discover that core functionality doesn't work and the architecture needs significant rework. The project that was supposed to take six months ends up taking eighteen months and exceeds budget by 200%. Another example involves a system integration project where multiple teams work independently without coordination. The project manager assumes everything is progressing well because each team reports making progress, but no one verifies that the different components will work together. Integration testing begins only two weeks before the planned go-live date, revealing fundamental incompatibilities that require months of additional work to resolve.
