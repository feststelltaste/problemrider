## Description

Reduced review participation occurs when many team members avoid or minimize their involvement in the code review process, leaving most reviews to be handled by a small subset of the team. This creates an uneven distribution of review workload, reduces the diversity of perspectives on code changes, and can lead to review bottlenecks when the active reviewers become overwhelmed or unavailable.

## Indicators ⟡

- Only 2-3 team members out of 8-10 regularly participate in code reviews
- Same individuals are consistently assigned or volunteer for reviews
- Junior developers rarely review senior developers' code
- Some team members go weeks without conducting any reviews
- Review assignments are declined or ignored by certain team members

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Review Bottlenecks](review-bottlenecks.md):** Limited reviewers create delays when active reviewers are busy or unavailable
- **[Mentor Burnout](mentor-burnout.md):** Active reviewers become overwhelmed with disproportionate review workload
- **Limited Review Perspectives:** Lack of diverse viewpoints reduces review effectiveness and learning opportunities
- **[Skill Development Gaps](skill-development-gaps.md):** Non-participating members miss opportunities to learn from reviewing others' code
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Knowledge becomes concentrated in the few active reviewers

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Reviewer Anxiety](reviewer-anxiety.md):** Team members feel uncomfortable or intimidated about reviewing code
- **Lack of Review Training:** Team members don't know how to conduct effective reviews
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Individual priorities make review participation seem optional or secondary
- **Hierarchy Intimidation:** Junior members feel they shouldn't review senior members' code
- **Poor Review Culture:** Reviews are seen as criticism rather than collaborative improvement

## Detection Methods ○

- **Review Participation Tracking:** Monitor how many team members actively participate in reviews over time
- **Review Workload Distribution Analysis:** Measure how review responsibilities are distributed across team members  
- **Participation Barrier Surveys:** Collect feedback on why team members avoid reviewing code
- **Review Assignment Acceptance Rates:** Track how often review requests are accepted versus declined
- **Skill Development Impact Assessment:** Evaluate learning outcomes for participating versus non-participating members

## Examples

A 10-person development team has only 3 senior developers who handle 90% of all code reviews, while 7 other team members rarely participate in the review process. When one of the active reviewers goes on vacation, the remaining two become overwhelmed and review quality suffers. The non-participating members miss valuable learning opportunities and remain unaware of coding patterns and design decisions being made across the codebase. Another example involves a team where junior developers feel they're not qualified to review anyone's code, mid-level developers only review other mid-level work, and senior developers review everything. This creates a hierarchy where most code only gets one perspective instead of the diverse viewpoints that make reviews valuable, and junior developers don't develop critical code analysis skills.
