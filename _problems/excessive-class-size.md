## Description
Excessive class size is a code smell where a class has grown so large that it becomes difficult to manage. Large classes often accumulate too many responsibilities, violating the single responsibility principle. This complexity makes the code harder to read, test, and maintain, increasing the likelihood of bugs and slowing down development.

## Indicators ⟡
- Classes with high line counts (e.g., over 500 or 1000 lines).
- A single class that is frequently modified by multiple developers for different reasons.
- Difficulty in naming the class succinctly because it does too many things.
- The class has a large number of methods and instance variables.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Difficult Code Comprehension](difficult-code-comprehension.md):** Developers struggle to understand the class and its purpose.
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** Changes to the class often introduce unintended side effects and bugs.
- **[Testing Complexity](testing-complexity.md):** Writing unit tests for the class is difficult due to its many dependencies and responsibilities.
- **[Maintenance Bottlenecks](maintenance-bottlenecks.md):** The class becomes a bottleneck for development, as many features depend on it.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Feature Creep Without Refactoring](feature-creep-without-refactoring.md):** New features are continuously added to existing classes without refactoring.
- **[Convenience-Driven Development](convenience-driven-development.md):** Developers add functionality to existing classes for convenience, rather than creating new ones.
- **[Poor Domain Model](poor-domain-model.md):** A lack of clear understanding of the business domain leads to poorly defined class boundaries.
- **[Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md):** The business domain being modeled is inherently complex, making class design challenging.
- **[Refactoring Avoidance](refactoring-avoidance.md):** Teams avoid refactoring large classes due to the perceived risk or time commitment.
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Team culture doesn't prioritize or value code restructuring activities.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Metrics Tools:** Use static analysis tools to measure class size, cyclomatic complexity, and other metrics.
- **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code for large classes and classes with multiple responsibilities.
- **Responsibility Analysis:** Analyze the methods and properties of a class to determine if it has a single, well-defined responsibility.

## Examples
In a large e-commerce application, a class named `Product` starts by managing product information like name, price, and description. Over time, it's modified to also handle inventory management, supplier details, customer reviews, and discount calculations. The class grows to thousands of lines of code, and a change to the discount logic risks breaking inventory updates. This is a classic example of excessive class size, where a single class has become a "god object," making the entire system fragile and difficult to maintain.
