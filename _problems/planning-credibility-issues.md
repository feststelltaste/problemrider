## Description

Planning credibility issues occur when development teams lose stakeholder trust in their ability to provide accurate estimates and realistic project plans due to a history of missed deadlines, scope changes, or inaccurate predictions. This loss of credibility creates a negative cycle where planning becomes less collaborative, stakeholders make independent commitments, and teams face even more pressure to meet unrealistic expectations.

## Indicators ⟡

- Stakeholders consistently question or disregard development estimates
- Business commitments are made without consulting development teams
- Management imposes deadlines rather than working with teams to establish realistic timelines
- Planning discussions focus on past failures rather than current project realities
- Teams are asked to "commit" to timelines rather than estimate them

## Symptoms ▲

- **Adversarial Planning Relationships:** Planning becomes a negotiation rather than a collaborative process
- **[Unrealistic Deadlines](unrealistic-deadlines.md):** Deadlines are imposed without considering development input
- **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:** Loss of trust leads to more unrealistic expectations and more failures
- **Defensive Planning:** Teams pad estimates excessively to protect against credibility loss
- **Communication Breakdown:** Stakeholders stop involving development teams in early planning discussions

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** History of failing to meet commitments erodes stakeholder confidence
- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Consistently inaccurate estimates damage team reputation for reliability
- **Communication Problems:** Failures to communicate risks and changes effectively to stakeholders
- **External Pressure:** Stakeholders under pressure make commitments without consulting development teams
- **Blame Culture:** Organizational culture that assigns blame for estimation errors rather than improving estimation processes
- **Lack of Shared Understanding:** Stakeholders and developers have different perspectives on estimation accuracy expectations

## Detection Methods ○

- **Stakeholder Trust Surveys:** Assess stakeholder confidence in development team planning and estimates
- **Planning Process Analysis:** Evaluate how planning discussions and decisions occur
- **Estimate Acceptance Rate:** Track how often development estimates are accepted vs. overridden
- **Communication Pattern Analysis:** Monitor whether development teams are included in early planning stages
- **Historical Accuracy Tracking:** Compare past estimates with actual outcomes to understand accuracy patterns

## Examples

A development team has missed their last four major project deadlines due to unforeseen technical complexity and changing requirements. Now when they estimate that a new customer portal will take 4 months to build, the product manager responds with "you always say that, but we need it in 2 months for the trade show." The business makes external commitments based on the 2-month timeline, forcing the team into an impossible situation. Another example involves a team whose estimates are consistently questioned in planning meetings, with stakeholders asking "but couldn't you do it faster if you really tried?" The team begins inflating estimates by 50% to account for inevitable pressure to reduce them, creating an adversarial dynamic where accurate planning becomes impossible.
