## Description

API versioning conflicts occur when different versions of APIs are incompatible, poorly managed, or inconsistently implemented across services. This leads to breaking changes, integration failures, and maintenance nightmares as clients and services struggle to coordinate compatible versions. Poor versioning strategies make it difficult to evolve APIs without disrupting existing integrations.

## Indicators ⟡

- Client applications break when APIs are updated
- Different services use incompatible API versions
- API changes require coordinated updates across multiple systems
- Documentation for different API versions is inconsistent or missing
- Integration tests fail due to version mismatches

## Symptoms ▲

- **Breaking Changes:** API updates break existing client integrations
- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** Services cannot communicate due to version incompatibilities
- **[Complex Deployment Process](complex-deployment-process.md):** API updates require complex orchestrated deployments
- **Client Compatibility Problems:** Clients must maintain compatibility with multiple API versions
- **Documentation Drift:** API documentation becomes inconsistent across versions

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** No clear strategy for managing API versions and evolution
- **Breaking Changes in Minor Versions:** Introducing breaking changes without proper version increments
- **Inconsistent Versioning Schemes:** Different APIs use different versioning approaches
- **Poor Backward Compatibility:** New versions don't maintain compatibility with previous versions
- **Inadequate Deprecation Process:** Old API versions removed without proper deprecation periods
- **Version Proliferation:** Too many API versions maintained simultaneously

## Detection Methods ○

- **API Compatibility Testing:** Test API changes against existing client integrations
- **Version Usage Analytics:** Monitor which API versions are being used by clients
- **Integration Test Monitoring:** Track integration test failures related to version mismatches
- **Client Feedback Analysis:** Monitor client reports of API compatibility issues
- **API Change Impact Analysis:** Assess the impact of API changes on existing integrations

## Examples

A payment processing service introduces a new required field in their API without incrementing the major version number. Existing e-commerce integrations start failing because they don't provide the new required field, causing checkout processes to break across multiple client applications. The service team didn't realize this was a breaking change and classified it as a minor update. Another example involves a microservices architecture where the user service updates to API v3, but the notification service still expects v2 responses. The incompatible data formats cause user notification failures, and the system requires careful coordination to upgrade all dependent services simultaneously.
