## Description

Cognitive overload occurs when developers are required to understand and work with more complex information than can be effectively maintained in working memory. This happens when systems are overly complex, when developers must work across multiple domains simultaneously, or when the architecture requires understanding many interconnected components to make simple changes. The human brain has limited working memory capacity, and exceeding this capacity leads to reduced performance, increased errors, and mental exhaustion.

## Indicators ⟡

- Developers frequently lose track of what they were working on
- Simple tasks require extensive note-taking or documentation to complete
- Team members express feeling overwhelmed by system complexity
- Developers avoid working on certain parts of the system due to complexity
- Frequent mistakes occur due to forgetting important context or constraints

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Mental Fatigue](mental-fatigue.md):** Developers feel exhausted from maintaining complex mental models
- **[Increased Error Rates](increased-error-rates.md):** More mistakes occur when cognitive capacity is exceeded
- **[Reduced Individual Productivity](reduced-individual-productivity.md):** Developers work slower when dealing with cognitive overload
- **[Avoidance Behaviors](avoidance-behaviors.md):** Complex tasks are postponed or avoided entirely
- **[Decision Paralysis](decision-paralysis.md):** Difficulty making decisions when overwhelmed with information

## Root Causes ▼

- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Tightly coupled systems require understanding many components simultaneously
- **Complex System Architecture:** System design exceeds reasonable cognitive complexity limits
- **[Context Switching Overhead](context-switching-overhead.md):** Frequent switching between different domains or systems
- **Poor Abstraction:** System doesn't provide appropriate levels of abstraction to manage complexity
- **Information Density:** Too much information presented simultaneously without proper organization
- **Inadequate Tooling:** Development tools don't help manage or reduce cognitive complexity

## Detection Methods ○

- **Complexity Metrics:** Measure cyclomatic complexity, coupling, and other architectural complexity indicators
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about cognitive burden and mental workload
- **Error Rate Analysis:** Monitor correlation between system complexity and developer mistake frequency
- **Task Completion Time Tracking:** Compare completion times for tasks of similar scope but different complexity
- **Focus Time Analysis:** Measure how long developers can maintain focus on complex tasks

## Examples

A developer working on an e-commerce platform must simultaneously understand the product catalog structure, inventory management rules, pricing algorithms, tax calculation logic, shipping cost determination, and promotion handling systems to implement a simple "buy now" button feature. The interconnections between these systems require maintaining detailed mental models of each component, exceeding cognitive capacity and leading to mistakes in the implementation. Another example involves a developer modifying a financial trading system where understanding a single function requires knowledge of market data protocols, risk management rules, regulatory compliance requirements, portfolio optimization algorithms, and real-time event processing patterns, creating cognitive overload that makes even simple changes error-prone and time-consuming.
