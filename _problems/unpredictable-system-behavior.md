## Description

Unpredictable system behavior occurs when modifications to one component cause unexpected changes or failures in other, seemingly unrelated parts of the system. This phenomenon is a hallmark of systems with poor separation of concerns, hidden dependencies, and implicit coupling. It makes software development extremely challenging because developers cannot reason about the impact of their changes, leading to defensive programming practices and reluctance to make necessary improvements.

## Indicators ⟡
- Developers frequently discover that their changes have affected unrelated functionality
- Bug reports mention symptoms that seem disconnected from recent changes
- Testing reveals failures in modules that weren't directly modified
- The team spends significant time investigating why changes broke seemingly unrelated features
- Code reviews focus heavily on trying to predict all possible side effects

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Cascade Failures](cascade-failures.md):** A single change triggers a chain reaction of failures across multiple system components
- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Developers become hesitant to modify code due to unpredictable consequences
- **Extended Testing Cycles:** Every change requires comprehensive system-wide testing to catch unexpected side effects
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** New defects appear in areas that weren't directly modified
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Root cause analysis becomes extremely complex when failures appear far from their actual cause

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Global State and Side Effects](global-state-and-side-effects.md):** Shared mutable state creates invisible connections between otherwise separate components
- **[Hidden Dependencies](hidden-dependencies.md):** Components depend on implementation details or assumptions that aren't explicitly documented or enforced
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Components are tightly interconnected, making changes propagate in unexpected ways
- **Implicit Contracts:** Components rely on undocumented behaviors or assumptions about how other components work
- **Order-Dependent Operations:** System behavior changes based on the sequence of operations, making it sensitive to timing changes
- **Shared Resources:** Multiple components compete for or share resources without proper coordination
- **[Configuration Drift](configuration-drift.md):** System configurations that have diverged from standards cause inconsistent behavior across environments

## Detection Methods ○
- **Impact Analysis Tools:** Use dependency analysis tools to map actual vs. expected component relationships
- **Regression Testing Patterns:** Monitor which tests fail when specific modules are changed to identify hidden connections
- **Side Effect Monitoring:** Track system state changes during operations to identify unexpected mutations
- **Code Coupling Metrics:** Measure coupling between modules to identify areas with high interconnectedness
- **Change Impact Tracking:** Maintain logs of which areas are affected by changes to identify patterns of unexpected impact

## Examples

A developer modifies a user authentication function to improve password validation. The change seems isolated and passes all authentication-related tests. However, after deployment, the reporting system begins generating incorrect data because it was implicitly relying on a specific timing of authentication events to synchronize its data collection. The reporting system never directly interacted with authentication, but it depended on side effects of the authentication process that were never documented or made explicit. This hidden dependency caused data corruption that took days to diagnose because the connection between authentication and reporting was not obvious. Another example involves updating a product catalog service where changing the product description format inadvertently breaks the recommendation engine, which was parsing description text to extract features for its machine learning model.
