## Description
A continuous feedback loop is essential for agile development, allowing teams to regularly inspect and adapt their process. When this loop is missing, teams operate in a vacuum, unaware of how their work is being received by users or whether they are on track to meet their goals. This can lead to a disconnect between the development team and the business, a failure to address issues in a timely manner, and a product that does not meet user needs. Establishing a regular cadence of feedback is crucial for any team that wants to improve.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team is not getting regular feedback from stakeholders.
- The team is not using a prototype or mockup to clarify requirements.
- The team is not getting feedback from users throughout the development process.
- The team is not doing regular demos or reviews.

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** The final product or feature does not match the expectations or requirements of the stakeholders.
- **Frequent Rework Post-Delivery:** Significant changes or re-implementations are required after a feature is considered "done."
- **Late Discovery of Issues:** Bugs, usability problems, or fundamental misunderstandings are only identified at the very end of the development cycle, making them expensive to fix.
- **Wasted Effort:** Development time and resources are spent building features that ultimately provide little value or need to be discarded.
- **Blame Game:** Tensions rise between development teams and stakeholders as each side feels misunderstood or unheard.

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md):** The team and stakeholders only communicate at the beginning and end of a development cycle, leaving no opportunity to clarify requirements or adjust course in between.
- **Lack of a Formal Feedback Mechanism:** There are no structured processes or regular cadences for stakeholders to provide feedback on incremental progress.
- **"Big Bang" Releases:** The project is developed in isolation for a long period, with a single large release at the end.
- **Fear of Showing Incomplete Work:** Developers or project managers are hesitant to show work in progress, preferring to present a "perfect" final product.
- **Stakeholder Unavailability:** Key stakeholders are too busy or disengaged to participate in regular feedback sessions.
- **Lack of Prototyping/Mockups:** Visual aids are not used early in the process to validate understanding of requirements.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Project Audits:** Review project plans and communication logs to see the frequency of stakeholder engagement and feedback sessions.
- **Post-Mortems/Retrospectives:** Analyze projects where deliverables were misaligned to identify the timing and effectiveness of feedback loops.
- **Bug Tracking Metrics:** Track the stage at which bugs or change requests are introduced (e.g., during development vs. after release).
- **Stakeholder Interviews:** Ask stakeholders about their involvement in the development process and their satisfaction with the feedback opportunities.

## Examples
A team spends six months developing a complex reporting module. They only show it to the business stakeholders a week before the planned launch. The stakeholders immediately identify several critical flaws and missing features that fundamentally change the module's utility, forcing a complete redesign and delaying the launch by several months. In another case, a web application is being developed. The design team creates mockups at the beginning, and the development team builds the UI based on those. However, there are no regular check-ins with the design team or end-users. When the UI is finally integrated, it's discovered that a key interaction flow is confusing and needs to be completely re-implemented. Continuous feedback loops are a cornerstone of agile and iterative development methodologies. Their absence leads to significant waste, increased risk, and a higher likelihood of delivering a product that fails to meet market or business needs, especially in the context of evolving legacy systems.
