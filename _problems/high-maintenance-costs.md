## Description
High maintenance costs are a common problem for legacy systems. As a system ages, it becomes more and more expensive to maintain. This is because the codebase becomes more complex, the technology becomes obsolete, and the original developers leave the company. Eventually, the cost of maintaining the system can become so high that it is no longer economically viable. At this point, the company is faced with a difficult choice: either invest in a costly modernization project or continue to pour money into a dying system.

## Indicators ⟡
- The development team spends more than 50% of its time on maintenance tasks.
- The company is constantly deferring new projects because it can't afford to both maintain the old system and build new ones.
- The cost of fixing a bug is often higher than the cost of the original feature.
- The business is hesitant to approve any changes to the system because of the high cost and risk.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md):** The company is unable to invest in new products and services because all of its resources are tied up in maintaining the old system.
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** The company is unable to keep up with its competitors who are able to innovate more quickly and cheaply.
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** The high cost of maintenance can lead to a decline in profitability and other key business metrics.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Developers can become demoralized by working on a system that is difficult and expensive to maintain.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** The accumulation of technical debt is the primary driver of high maintenance costs.
- **[Obsolete Technologies](obsolete-technologies.md):** The use of outdated technologies can make it difficult and expensive to find developers with the right skills.
- **Lack of Documentation:** The absence of good documentation makes it difficult for new developers to understand the system, which increases the cost of maintenance.
- **[High Turnover](high-turnover.md):** When the original developers leave the company, they take with them a wealth of knowledge about the system. This knowledge is expensive to replace.
- **[Workaround Culture](workaround-culture.md):** A culture of implementing quick and dirty workarounds instead of proper fixes can lead to a system that is complex and expensive to maintain.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Cost of Ownership Analysis:** Calculate the total cost of owning and maintaining the system over its lifetime. This will give you a clear picture of the financial impact of the system.
- **Maintenance vs. New Development Ratio:** Track the percentage of the development budget that is spent on maintenance versus new development. A high ratio is a clear sign of a problem.
- **Bug Fix Cost Analysis:** Analyze the cost of fixing bugs over time. A rising cost is a sign that the system is becoming more difficult to maintain.
- **Business Value Assessment:** Assess the business value that the system is providing. If the cost of maintaining the system is greater than the value it is providing, it is time to consider decommissioning it.

## Examples
A large financial institution is running its core banking system on a mainframe that is over 30 years old. The system is written in COBOL, and it is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to find developers who are proficient in the language. The company is spending millions of dollars a year just to keep the system running. They are unable to invest in new, innovative products because all of their resources are tied up in maintaining the old system. The company is stuck in a difficult position: they know that they need to modernize their system, but they are afraid of the cost and risk of such a large project.
