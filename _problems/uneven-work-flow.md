## Description

Uneven work flow occurs when development work progresses irregularly, with periods of intense activity followed by periods of waiting or slow progress. This pattern indicates problems with process design, resource allocation, or dependency management that prevent smooth, predictable work progression. Uneven flow reduces overall efficiency and makes planning and prediction difficult.

## Indicators ⟡

- Work completion varies dramatically between time periods
- Team alternates between being very busy and having little to do
- Some team members are consistently overloaded while others have spare capacity
- Project velocity varies significantly between sprints or time periods
- Work often gets stuck at certain stages for unpredictable amounts of time

## Symptoms ▲

- **Unpredictable Delivery:** Difficulty predicting when work will be completed
- **Resource Utilization Problems:** Some resources are overutilized while others are underutilized
- **Planning Difficulties:** Irregular flow makes sprint planning and estimation challenging
- **[Increased Stress and Burnout](increased-stress-and-burnout.md):** Alternating periods of intense work and waiting create stress
- **Quality Variations:** Work quality varies depending on time pressure and flow conditions

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md):** Constraints in the process create irregular flow patterns
- **Batch Processing:** Work is processed in large batches rather than continuously
- **Dependency Mismanagement:** Poor coordination of dependencies creates start-stop patterns
- **[Resource Allocation Failures](resource-allocation-failures.md):** Resources aren't allocated to match work flow patterns
- **[Process Design Flaws](process-design-flaws.md):** Development process isn't designed for smooth flow

## Detection Methods ○

- **Flow Variability Analysis:** Measure the variation in work completion rates over time
- **Cycle Time Distribution:** Analyze the distribution of cycle times to identify irregular patterns
- **Resource Utilization Tracking:** Monitor how resource utilization varies over time
- **Work-in-Progress Monitoring:** Track how WIP levels change and identify accumulation points
- **Team Velocity Variance:** Measure how much team velocity varies between time periods

## Examples

A software development team experiences a pattern where they complete most of their sprint work in the final two days, after spending the first week and a half dealing with blockers, waiting for approvals, and context-switching between partially completed tasks. This creates intense pressure at sprint end and makes it impossible to maintain consistent quality or predict completion times. Another example involves a data processing team where work flows smoothly until it reaches the data validation stage, where a single expert must review all outputs. Work backs up at this stage for days, then gets processed in a rush when the expert is available, creating an irregular stop-and-go pattern that makes the entire process unpredictable and stressful.
