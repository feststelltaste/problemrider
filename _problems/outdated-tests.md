## Description

Outdated tests occur when test code is not maintained alongside production code changes, resulting in tests that no longer accurately verify the intended behavior. These tests may pass when they should fail (false positives) or fail when the code is actually correct (false negatives). Outdated tests are worse than no tests because they provide false confidence in code quality while consuming maintenance effort and slowing down development with spurious failures.

## Indicators ⟡
- Tests pass but the functionality they're supposed to verify is broken
- Tests fail consistently for reasons unrelated to actual code defects
- Test failures are frequently ignored or bypassed because they're known to be unreliable
- Tests verify outdated business rules or deprecated functionality
- Significant effort is spent maintaining and debugging tests rather than improving them

## Symptoms ▲
- **False Security:** Teams believe functionality is tested when it actually isn't
- **Test Maintenance Burden:** Disproportionate time spent fixing broken tests rather than improving code
- **Reduced Test Confidence:** Developers stop trusting test results due to frequent false positives and negatives
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** Outdated tests fail to provide meaningful quality assurance
- **Development Friction:** Unreliable tests slow down development and deployment processes

## Root Causes ▼
- **Poor Test Maintenance Practices:** Tests are not updated when corresponding production code changes
- **Lack of Test Ownership:** No clear responsibility for maintaining test code quality
- **Copy-Paste Test Development:** Tests are duplicated without understanding, making maintenance difficult
- **External Dependency Changes:** Tests break when external services or data formats change
- **Business Rule Evolution:** Tests continue to verify old business logic after requirements change
- **Technical Debt in Tests:** Test code itself accumulates technical debt making it difficult to maintain

## Detection Methods ○
- **Test Reliability Metrics:** Track the frequency of test failures and their correlation with actual bugs
- **Test Maintenance Time:** Monitor how much time is spent fixing tests versus improving functionality
- **False Positive/Negative Analysis:** Identify tests that provide incorrect results about code quality
- **Test Age Analysis:** Examine how long tests have gone without updates relative to code changes
- **Developer Feedback:** Survey team members about their confidence in test reliability

## Examples

A user authentication system has comprehensive tests that verify password complexity requirements including rules about special characters, length, and character mixing. However, the business requirements changed six months ago to allow simpler passwords to improve user experience, and the production code was updated accordingly. The tests still verify the old, stricter requirements and continue to pass even though the system now accepts passwords that violate the rules the tests check. Developers and stakeholders believe the password validation is thoroughly tested, but the actual validation logic has no meaningful test coverage. Another example involves an e-commerce pricing system where tests verify discount calculations using hardcoded product IDs and prices from the original test database. Over time, the test database has been modified, products have been discontinued, and pricing structures have changed. The tests now fail intermittently depending on database state, and developers regularly update test data to make tests pass without verifying that the discount logic actually works correctly. The tests have become maintenance overhead that provides no assurance about pricing calculation accuracy.
