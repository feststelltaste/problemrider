## Description

Deadlock conditions occur when two or more threads or processes are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource that it needs to continue execution. This creates a circular dependency where no thread can proceed, effectively freezing part or all of the application. Deadlocks are a classic concurrency problem that can cause applications to hang, become unresponsive, or require forceful termination.

## Indicators ⟡

- Application suddenly becomes unresponsive or appears to freeze
- Threads are blocked waiting for locks that are held by other blocked threads
- Database transactions timeout due to lock conflicts
- User interface becomes non-responsive during certain operations
- System monitoring shows threads in waiting states that never progress

## Symptoms ▲

- **Application Hanging:** Application or specific features become completely unresponsive
- **Thread Blocking:** Multiple threads remain in blocked or waiting states indefinitely
- **[Service Timeouts](service-timeouts.md):** Operations timeout because required resources cannot be acquired
- **User Interface Freezing:** GUI applications become unresponsive to user interactions
- **[Synchronization Problems](synchronization-problems.md):** Race conditions and coordination issues between concurrent operations

## Root Causes ▼

- **Lock Ordering Issues:** Different threads acquire multiple locks in different orders, creating circular wait conditions
- **Nested Lock Acquisition:** Functions call other functions that acquire locks, creating complex lock dependency chains
- **[Resource Contention](resource-contention.md):** Multiple threads compete for the same set of limited resources
- **Transaction Deadlocks:** Database transactions hold locks on different resources and wait for each other
- **Poor Concurrency Design:** Inadequate design of multi-threaded components and their interactions
- **Exception Handling in Critical Sections:** Exceptions prevent proper lock release, leading to indefinite blocking

## Detection Methods ○

- **Deadlock Detection Tools:** Use debugging tools and profilers that can identify circular wait conditions
- **Thread Dump Analysis:** Analyze thread dumps to identify blocked threads and their lock dependencies
- **Database Lock Monitoring:** Monitor database lock tables to identify transaction deadlocks
- **Application Logging:** Log lock acquisition and release to trace deadlock patterns
- **Timeout Implementation:** Use timeouts on lock acquisition to detect potential deadlock situations
- **Static Analysis:** Analyze code for potential deadlock patterns and lock ordering issues

## Examples

A banking application has two threads processing money transfers. Thread A locks Account 1 and tries to lock Account 2, while Thread B locks Account 2 and tries to lock Account 1. Both threads wait indefinitely for the other to release its lock, causing the entire transfer system to freeze and requiring application restart. Another example involves a resource management system where Thread 1 acquires a database connection and then tries to acquire a file lock, while Thread 2 acquires the file lock and then tries to acquire a database connection. The circular dependency prevents either thread from completing its operation, causing the application to hang until the deadlock is manually resolved.
