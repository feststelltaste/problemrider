## Description

Hardcoded values are literal numbers, strings, or other constants embedded directly in source code rather than being defined as configurable parameters, constants, or external configuration. This practice reduces system flexibility by making it difficult to modify behavior without changing and redeploying code. The problem is particularly problematic in systems that need to adapt to different environments, handle varying business rules, or accommodate changing requirements over time.

## Indicators ⟡

- Code that contains unexplained numeric literals or "magic numbers" without context
- String values like URLs, file paths, or messages embedded directly in business logic
- Different versions of similar code that vary only by hardcoded values
- Requests for "simple" configuration changes that require code modifications
- Difficulty setting up the same application in different environments
- Business rules that are scattered throughout the codebase as literal values
- Test files that duplicate production code just to change embedded values

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Complex Deployment Process](complex-deployment-process.md):** Configuration changes that require full development cycles instead of simple parameter updates
- **[Deployment Environment Inconsistencies](deployment-environment-inconsistencies.md):** Multiple deployments needed to accommodate different environments or customers
- **[Code Duplication](code-duplication.md):** Code duplication where the only differences are embedded constant values
- **[Difficult to Test Code](difficult-to-test-code.md):** Difficulty testing edge cases because values cannot be easily modified for test scenarios
- **[High Maintenance Costs](high-maintenance-costs.md):** Maintenance overhead when the same hardcoded value appears in multiple locations
- **[Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md):** Business stakeholders unable to make operational adjustments without developer involvement
- **[Environment Variable Issues](environment-variable-issues.md):** Systems that break when moved between environments due to embedded assumptions
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Debugging challenges when trying to understand the meaning of mysterious numeric values
- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Reluctance to modify code due to uncertainty about hardcoded value impacts
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Development delays for changes that should be simple configuration updates
- **[Legacy Configuration Management Chaos](legacy-configuration-management-chaos.md):** Configuration complexity that prevents modern deployment practices
- **[Inconsistent Behavior](inconsistent-behavior.md):** Different system behavior when hardcoded values diverge across environments
- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** Challenges integrating with other systems due to inflexible hardcoded assumptions
- **[Operational Overhead](operational-overhead.md):** Manual processes required to manage systems with embedded configuration

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Development shortcuts taken to meet deadlines without considering long-term flexibility
- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Lack of awareness about the future configuration needs of the system
- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Insufficient planning for multi-environment deployment scenarios
- **[Inexperienced Developers](inexperienced-developers.md):** Developer inexperience with configuration management patterns and practices
- **[Undefined Code Style Guidelines](undefined-code-style-guidelines.md):** Absence of clear guidelines about when values should be externalized vs. embedded
- **[Short-Term Focus](short-term-focus.md):** Code written for single-use scenarios that later need to be generalized
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Legacy systems that accumulated hardcoded values over time without refactoring
- **[Short-Term Focus](short-term-focus.md):** Pressure to minimize complexity by avoiding configuration systems
- **[Copy-Paste Programming](copy-paste-programming.md):** Code duplication that spreads hardcoded values throughout the system
- **[Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md):** Code review processes that don't catch hardcoded value problems
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Insufficient understanding of configuration management best practices
- **[Legacy Business Logic Extraction Difficulty](legacy-business-logic-extraction-difficulty.md):** Business rules embedded as hardcoded values in legacy systems
- **[Procedural Programming in OOP Languages](procedural-programming-in-oop-languages.md):** Programming approaches that don't use proper configuration patterns
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** Magic numbers and constants that make code cryptic and unmaintainable
- **[Resistance to Change](resistance-to-change.md):** Organizational resistance to implementing proper configuration management

## Detection Methods ○

- Use static analysis tools to identify magic numbers and repeated string literals
- Code reviews that specifically look for unexplained literal values in business logic
- Analyze deployment processes to identify values that need to change between environments
- Review configuration change requests to identify patterns of hardcoded dependencies
- Examine test code for workarounds needed due to inflexible hardcoded values
- Survey operations and business teams about limitations in system configuration
- Audit codebase for repeated literal values that should be centralized as constants
- Monitor development time spent on changes that should be simple configuration updates

## Examples

An e-commerce application has shipping cost calculations hardcoded throughout the codebase with values like `if (weight > 50) shippingCost = 15.99` and timeout values like `setTimeout(checkStatus, 30000)`. When the business wants to offer promotions, adjust shipping rates for different regions, or optimize performance by changing timeout values, each change requires code modifications, testing, and deployment. A particularly problematic situation arises when they need to support international customers - the hardcoded USD currency symbols, US zip code validation patterns, and English error messages are scattered across dozens of files. What should be simple business configuration changes become multi-week development projects, and supporting multiple markets requires maintaining separate code branches with different hardcoded values.
