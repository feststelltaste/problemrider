## Description
Limited team learning is a situation where a team does not learn from its mistakes and does not improve over time. This is a common problem in teams that do not have a culture of continuous improvement. Limited team learning can lead to a number of problems, including a decrease in productivity, an increase in the number of bugs, and a general sense of stagnation.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team is making the same mistakes over and over again.
- The team is not getting any better at what they do.
- There is a lack of innovation on the team.
- The team is not able to adapt to change.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** It takes a long time to get things done because the team is not learning from its mistakes.
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** The number of bugs is increasing because the team is not learning from its mistakes.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Developers get frustrated with the lack of progress and the feeling that they are not getting any better at what they do.
- **[Stagnant Architecture](stagnant-architecture.md):** The architecture of the system is not evolving because the team is not learning from its mistakes.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** The knowledge is not shared with the rest of the team, so the team is not able to learn from each other's mistakes.
- **[Feedback Isolation](feedback-isolation.md):** There is no feedback loop in place, so the team is not able to learn from its mistakes.
- **[Blame Culture](blame-culture.md):** The team has a blame culture, so people are afraid to admit their mistakes.
- **[Fear of Failure](fear-of-failure.md):** People are afraid to take risks and try new things because they are afraid of failing.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Retrospectives:** Use retrospectives to identify what went well and what went wrong.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they feel like they are learning and growing on the team.
- **Code Reviews:** Look for code that is not up to the team's standards.

## Examples
A team is working on a new project. The team is making a lot of mistakes, but they are not learning from them. The team is not holding regular retrospectives, and they do not have a feedback loop in place. As a result, the team is not getting any better at what they do. The project is behind schedule, and the code quality is poor.
