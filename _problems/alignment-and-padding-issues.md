## Description

Alignment and padding issues occur when data structures are organized in ways that create excessive memory waste due to compiler-inserted padding bytes and poor field ordering. Modern processors require data to be aligned on specific byte boundaries for optimal performance, and compilers insert padding to ensure this alignment. Poor structure design can lead to significant memory waste, reduced cache efficiency, and increased memory bandwidth usage.

## Indicators ⟡

- Data structures consume more memory than the sum of their individual field sizes
- Cache performance is poor despite reasonable algorithmic access patterns
- Memory profiling shows unexpected memory usage for data structures
- Sizeof operations return values much larger than expected
- Performance varies significantly with minor structure field rearrangements

## Symptoms ▲

- **Memory Waste:** Structures consume significantly more memory than necessary due to padding

- **Bandwidth Inefficiency:** More memory bandwidth consumed due to padding and misalignment
- **[Memory Fragmentation](memory-fragmentation.md):** Inefficient structure sizes exacerbate memory fragmentation
- **[Data Structure Cache Inefficiency](data-structure-cache-inefficiency.md):** Structures span multiple cache lines unnecessarily

## Root Causes ▼

- **Poor Field Ordering:** Structure fields ordered without consideration for alignment requirements
- **Mixed Data Types:** Combining small and large data types without considering alignment
- **Compiler Padding:** Automatic compiler padding to meet alignment requirements
- **Platform Differences:** Different alignment requirements across target platforms
- **Bit Field Misuse:** Inefficient use of bit fields causing alignment issues
- **Structure Inheritance:** Object-oriented inheritance creating alignment gaps

## Detection Methods ○

- **Structure Size Analysis:** Compare actual structure sizes with theoretical minimum sizes
- **Memory Layout Visualization:** Use tools to visualize structure memory layout and padding
- **Alignment Analysis Tools:** Static analysis tools that identify alignment inefficiencies
- **Cache Performance Profiling:** Monitor cache utilization efficiency for data structures
- **Memory Usage Profiling:** Profile actual memory consumption vs expected consumption
- **Cross-Platform Testing:** Test structure sizes across different platforms and compilers

## Examples

A network packet structure contains a 1-byte type field, followed by a 4-byte length field, then a 1-byte flags field, and finally an 8-byte timestamp. Due to alignment requirements, the compiler inserts 3 bytes of padding after the type field, 3 bytes after the flags field, making the 14-byte logical structure consume 24 bytes of memory - a 71% increase. Reordering fields to group similar-sized types together (8-byte timestamp, 4-byte length, 1-byte type, 1-byte flags) reduces the structure to 16 bytes. Another example involves a vertex structure for 3D graphics containing position (12 bytes), a single byte material ID, and texture coordinates (8 bytes). The compiler adds 3 bytes of padding after the material ID, making each vertex 24 bytes instead of 21, which wastes memory and reduces the number of vertices that fit in cache.
