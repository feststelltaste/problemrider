## Description

The God Object anti-pattern occurs when single classes or components accumulate too many responsibilities and become overly complex, often handling multiple unrelated concerns within a single unit. These objects become difficult to understand, maintain, test, and modify because they violate the single responsibility principle and create bottlenecks for development and maintenance.

## Indicators ⟡

- Classes with hundreds or thousands of lines of code
- Single objects handling multiple unrelated business concerns
- Methods that perform many different types of operations
- Classes that are difficult to name because they do too many things
- Components that multiple teams need to modify for different reasons

## Symptoms ▲

- **Excessive Class Size:** Classes with very high line counts and method counts
- **Multiple Responsibilities:** Single objects handling unrelated business logic
- **Testing Complexity:** Difficult to write unit tests due to many dependencies and responsibilities
- **Maintenance Bottlenecks:** Changes to the object affecting many different features
- **Team Coordination Issues:** Multiple developers frequently modifying the same large object

## Root Causes ▼

- **Feature Addition Without Refactoring:** Continuously adding new features to existing classes
- **Lack of Responsibility Separation:** Not identifying and separating distinct concerns
- **Convenience-Driven Development:** Adding functionality to existing objects for convenience
- **Missing Domain Modeling:** Poor understanding of business domain boundaries
- **Refactoring Avoidance:** Avoiding refactoring due to perceived risk or time constraints
- **Single Entry Point Design:** Designing systems with single objects as entry points for everything

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Metrics Analysis:** Monitor class size, method count, and complexity metrics
- **Responsibility Analysis:** Review what different methods and properties in classes do
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Track how often and why large objects are modified
- **Testing Coverage Analysis:** Identify objects that are difficult to test comprehensively
- **Team Collaboration Metrics:** Monitor how often multiple developers modify same objects

## Examples

An e-commerce application has a `OrderManager` class that handles order creation, payment processing, inventory updates, shipping calculations, tax calculations, customer notifications, order status tracking, refund processing, and reporting. The class has over 2,000 lines of code and 50+ methods. When the tax calculation logic needs to change, developers risk breaking payment processing. When inventory management needs updates, it affects shipping calculations. The class is so complex that comprehensive testing requires setting up databases, payment processors, shipping services, and email systems, making unit testing nearly impossible. Another example involves a user management system with a `User` class that handles authentication, authorization, profile management, preferences, notification settings, activity tracking, friend relationships, content creation, and reporting. Any change to user preferences affects authentication code, and changes to friend relationships can break content creation features, making the system fragile and difficult to maintain.
