## Description

Unrealistic deadlines occur when project timelines are set without proper consideration of the actual effort required, system complexity, available resources, or potential risks. These deadlines often stem from business pressures, competitive concerns, or misunderstanding of development complexity. Unrealistic deadlines create a cascade of problems including quality compromises, developer stress, and ultimately missed delivery targets.

## Indicators ⟡

- Deadlines are set before development estimates are provided
- Project timelines don't align with team capacity or historical velocity
- Deadlines remain fixed even when scope increases or complexity is discovered
- Teams consistently work overtime to meet deadlines
- Quality standards are compromised to meet timeline constraints

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Constant pressure to deliver faster than sustainable development practices allow
- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Unrealistic targets inevitably lead to schedule slips
- **[Increased Technical Shortcuts](increased-technical-shortcuts.md):** Quality is sacrificed to meet impossible timelines
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team members become stressed and exhausted trying to meet unrealistic expectations
- **Scope Cutting:** Features are removed or simplified to fit unrealistic timelines

## Root Causes ▼

- **Business Pressure:** External commitments or competitive pressure drive aggressive timeline demands
- **Planning Disconnection:** Project timelines are set without involving development teams in estimation
- **Optimistic Bias:** Systematic underestimation of development complexity and potential problems
- **Resource Assumptions:** Deadlines assume ideal conditions without accounting for interruptions or dependencies
- **Lack of Historical Data:** Previous project data isn't used to inform realistic timeline estimates
- **Political Factors:** Deadlines are influenced by announcement schedules or business events rather than development realities

## Detection Methods ○

- **Estimate vs. Deadline Analysis:** Compare development estimates with imposed deadlines
- **Historical Timeline Analysis:** Track accuracy of deadline predictions over time
- **Team Capacity Assessment:** Measure actual team capacity against planned work
- **Overtime Tracking:** Monitor work hours required to meet deadlines
- **Quality Impact Analysis:** Assess correlation between tight deadlines and defect rates

## Examples

A marketing team commits to launching a new e-commerce feature at a trade show in 6 weeks, but the development team estimates the work requires 12 weeks based on the complexity of integrating with existing inventory and payment systems. Management insists the deadline is non-negotiable, forcing the team to implement a simplified version with significant limitations and several workarounds. The rushed implementation introduces bugs that require 3 weeks of post-launch fixes, ultimately taking longer than the original estimate. Another example involves a mobile app where management promises a major update to investors in 2 months, but the development team needs 4 months to properly implement the new features and ensure compatibility across device types. The team delivers on time by skipping comprehensive testing, resulting in crashes on 30% of devices and requiring emergency patches that damage the company's reputation.
