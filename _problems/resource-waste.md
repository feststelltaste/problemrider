## Description

Resource waste occurs when available capacity, skills, or tools are not utilized effectively while other parts of the organization remain constrained or overloaded. This inefficiency can manifest as idle team members while others work overtime, underutilized expensive tools while teams lack basic resources, or available expertise going unused while problems persist in related areas.

## Indicators ⟡

- Some resources remain idle while others are overutilized
- Expensive tools or licenses sit unused while teams struggle with inadequate alternatives
- Available expertise isn't leveraged to solve related problems
- Resources are allocated based on historical patterns rather than current needs
- Investment in resources doesn't translate to proportional productivity gains

## Symptoms ▲

- **Capacity Underutilization:** Available capacity goes unused while work queues build up elsewhere
- **Cost Inefficiency:** High resource costs without corresponding productivity benefits
- **Bottleneck Persistence:** Constraints remain despite available resources that could help
- **Team Frustration:** Team members frustrated by inefficient resource allocation
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** Inefficient resource use reduces organizational competitiveness

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Capacity Mismatch](capacity-mismatch.md):** Resource allocation doesn't match actual demand patterns
- **Poor Resource Planning:** Inadequate analysis of resource needs and allocation
- **Organizational Silos:** Resources aren't shared across organizational boundaries
- **[Process Design Flaws](process-design-flaws.md):** Processes don't effectively utilize available resources
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Management doesn't understand how to effectively allocate resources

## Detection Methods ○

- **Resource Utilization Analysis:** Monitor how effectively different resources are being used
- **Cost-Benefit Assessment:** Evaluate return on investment for different resource allocations
- **Capacity vs. Demand Analysis:** Compare available capacity with actual demand patterns
- **Cross-Team Resource Sharing:** Identify opportunities for better resource utilization across teams
- **Workflow Efficiency Review:** Assess whether processes make good use of available resources

## Examples

A software development organization pays for expensive development tools and cloud resources that are used at only 30% capacity, while developers on other teams struggle with inadequate development environments and slow build processes. The resource allocation is based on historical departmental budgets rather than actual usage patterns and needs. Another example involves a company where senior developers spend time on routine maintenance tasks while junior developers remain idle due to lack of suitable assignments, wasting both the senior developers' expertise and the junior developers' available capacity.
