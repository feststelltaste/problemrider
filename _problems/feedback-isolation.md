## Description

Feedback isolation occurs when development teams work for extended periods without receiving input from stakeholders, users, or business representatives about whether their work is meeting requirements and expectations. This isolation creates a dangerous gap between what developers build and what is actually needed, leading to significant rework, missed requirements, and products that fail to solve real problems. The longer the isolation persists, the more expensive and disruptive the eventual corrections become.

## Indicators ⟡

- Stakeholder feedback is only gathered at major milestones or project completion
- Users don't see working software until very late in the development cycle
- Requirements are interpreted without opportunity for clarification or validation
- Development team makes assumptions about user needs without verification
- Feedback, when received, results in significant changes or rework

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** Final product doesn't meet stakeholder expectations or user needs
- **[User Frustration](user-frustration.md):** Users are dissatisfied with delivered functionality
- **[Stakeholder-Developer Communication Gap](stakeholder-developer-communication-gap.md):** Persistent misunderstanding between business and technical teams
- **[Implementation Rework](implementation-rework.md):** Significant code changes required after feedback is received
- **[Delayed Value Delivery](delayed-value-delivery.md):** Long cycles between development work and user value realization
- **[Assumption-Based Development](assumption-based-development.md):** Teams make incorrect assumptions about user needs

## Root Causes ▼

- **Waterfall Development Practices:** Feedback is scheduled only at specific project phases
- **Stakeholder Availability Issues:** Key stakeholders are too busy to provide regular feedback
- **Geographic or Time Zone Separation:** Physical distance makes regular collaboration difficult
- **Process Rigidity:** Development process doesn't accommodate frequent feedback loops
- **Demo Culture Problems:** Demonstrations focus on technical features rather than user value
- **Fear of Showing Incomplete Work:** Teams wait until features are "finished" before seeking feedback
- **Proxy Communication:** Feedback goes through intermediaries rather than direct user contact

## Detection Methods ○

- **Feedback Frequency Analysis:** Track how often stakeholders and users provide input
- **Rework Metrics:** Measure how much development work gets changed after feedback
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess whether stakeholders feel heard during development
- **User Validation Tracking:** Monitor how often user assumptions are validated during development
- **Demo Effectiveness Assessment:** Evaluate whether demonstrations lead to meaningful feedback
- **Requirement Change Analysis:** Track how requirements evolve based on feedback

## Examples

A development team spends four months building a complex data visualization dashboard based on detailed requirements documents, only to discover during the final demo that users actually need simple summary reports and find the dashboard too complicated for their daily workflow. The requirements were accurate but missed the context of how users would actually interact with the system. Another example involves a mobile app development project where the team builds features based on stakeholder descriptions but doesn't show working prototypes until three months into development. When users finally test the app, they reveal that their mental model of the workflow is completely different from what was implemented, requiring a fundamental redesign of the user interface and core functionality.
