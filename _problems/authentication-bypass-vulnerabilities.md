## Description

Authentication bypass vulnerabilities occur when security flaws in authentication mechanisms allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to protected resources without providing valid credentials. These vulnerabilities can result from logic errors, implementation flaws, or design weaknesses that circumvent intended security controls, potentially exposing sensitive data and functionality to unauthorized users.

## Indicators ⟡

- Users can access protected resources without proper authentication
- Authentication checks can be circumvented through manipulation
- Login processes accept invalid or malformed credentials
- Authentication state can be manipulated by users
- Security logs show successful access without corresponding authentication events

## Symptoms ▲

- **Direct Resource Access:** Protected endpoints accessible without authentication tokens
- **Credential Validation Bypass:** Authentication accepting invalid or empty credentials
- **[Session Management Issues](session-management-issues.md):** Users can forge or manipulate authentication sessions
- **Logic Flow Circumvention:** Authentication logic can be bypassed through alternate code paths
- **Token Validation Failures:** Authentication tokens not properly validated or can be forged

## Root Causes ▼

- **Incomplete Authentication Checks:** Not all protected endpoints properly validate authentication
- **Logic Errors in Authentication Flow:** Flawed conditional logic allowing bypass conditions
- **Client-Side Authentication:** Relying on client-side validation instead of server-side enforcement
- **[Password Security Weaknesses](password-security-weaknesses.md):** Systems using default passwords or weak credential requirements
- **[Session Management Issues](session-management-issues.md):** Weak token generation, validation, or storage mechanisms
- **Parameter Manipulation Vulnerabilities:** Authentication decisions based on manipulable client parameters

## Detection Methods ○

- **Security Testing and Penetration Testing:** Test authentication mechanisms for bypass vulnerabilities
- **Code Review and Static Analysis:** Review authentication logic for potential bypass conditions
- **Access Control Testing:** Verify all protected resources require proper authentication
- **Authentication Flow Analysis:** Analyze complete authentication workflows for logic flaws
- **Session Management Testing:** Test session token generation, validation, and lifecycle management

## Examples

A web application checks user authentication by validating a user ID parameter in the URL, but fails to verify that the authenticated user actually owns that ID. An attacker can change the user ID parameter to access other users' data without additional authentication. The application treats any valid session as sufficient for any user ID, effectively allowing horizontal privilege escalation. Another example involves an API that validates authentication tokens but has a fallback mechanism that allows access with a special "admin" parameter. During testing, developers added this backdoor for convenience but forgot to remove it from production. Attackers discovering this parameter can bypass all authentication by adding "admin=true" to their requests, gaining full system access.
