## Description

Delayed bug fixes occur when known issues, defects, or problems remain unresolved for extended periods despite being identified and documented. This can happen due to prioritization decisions, resource constraints, technical complexity, or avoidance behaviors. Prolonged delays in addressing bugs can lead to user frustration, workarounds that create additional complexity, and compound problems as delayed fixes become more difficult to implement.

## Indicators ⟡

- Bug reports remain open for weeks or months without resolution
- Similar bugs are reported repeatedly by different users
- Team consistently prioritizes new features over bug fixes
- Critical bugs are downgraded to lower priorities without clear justification
- Workarounds become permanent solutions instead of addressing root causes

## Symptoms ▲

- **[User Frustration](user-frustration.md):** Users become frustrated with persistent problems
- **[Accumulation of Workarounds](accumulation-of-workarounds.md):** Temporary fixes become permanent, adding complexity
- **System Reliability Issues:** Unresolved bugs compound to create larger stability problems
- **[Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md):** Support team spends time on recurring issues
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Delayed fixes become more complex and risky over time

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Competing Priorities](competing-priorities.md):** New feature development takes precedence over bug fixes
- **[Avoidance Behaviors](avoidance-behaviors.md):** Team avoids difficult or risky bug fixes
- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Concern that fixing bugs might break other functionality
- **[Project Resource Constraints](project-resource-constraints.md):** Insufficient personnel or time allocated to bug resolution
- **Poor Bug Triage:** Inadequate process for prioritizing and assigning bug fixes

## Detection Methods ○

- **Bug Age Analysis:** Track how long bugs remain open before resolution
- **Bug Recurrence Monitoring:** Identify bugs that are reported multiple times
- **Priority vs Resolution Time:** Compare bug priority ratings with actual resolution timelines
- **User Complaint Correlation:** Connect delayed bug fixes to customer support issues
- **Technical Debt Impact Assessment:** Measure how delayed fixes contribute to system complexity

## Examples

A web application has a known bug where user sessions occasionally expire without warning, forcing users to re-enter form data. The bug was reported six months ago and affects roughly 5% of users daily, but it's been consistently deprioritized because it's "not critical" and the development team is focused on launching new features to attract more users. Customer support receives several complaints about this issue every week, and users have started saving their work in external documents before submitting forms. The longer the bug remains unfixed, the more complex the fix becomes because the session management code has been modified for other features, making the original fix more risky to implement. Another example involves a legacy reporting system where certain reports occasionally generate incorrect totals due to a race condition in the calculation logic. The bug is known and understood, but it occurs in a complex part of the system that the team avoids working on. Rather than fixing the root cause, the team has implemented multiple workarounds and manual verification steps that require additional developer time every month, ultimately costing more effort than fixing the original bug would have required.
