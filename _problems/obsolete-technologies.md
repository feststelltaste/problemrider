## Description

Obsolete technologies refer to the use of outdated programming languages, frameworks, libraries, or development tools that are no longer actively maintained, have been superseded by better alternatives, or lack support for modern development practices. These technologies create barriers to implementing current best practices, make it difficult to find qualified developers, and often introduce security vulnerabilities. Legacy systems commonly suffer from this problem as they age and their technology stack becomes increasingly outdated.

## Indicators ⟡
- Key dependencies have not been updated in several years
- Official support for the technology stack has ended or is ending soon
- Security patches are no longer available for critical components
- It's difficult to hire developers with expertise in the current technology stack
- Modern development tools and practices cannot be applied to the existing system

## Symptoms ▲
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Outdated components have known security issues without available patches
- **[Difficult Developer Onboarding](difficult-developer-onboarding.md):** New developers struggle to learn deprecated or obsolete technologies
- **Limited Tool Support:** Modern IDEs, debugging tools, and development utilities don't support the legacy technology stack
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Development is hindered by lack of modern tooling and frameworks
- **Integration Challenges:** Difficulty connecting with modern systems and APIs due to outdated protocols or data formats

## Root Causes ▼
- **Long System Lifespan:** Systems that have been in production for many years naturally encounter technology obsolescence
- **Delayed Modernization:** Postponing technology updates due to cost, risk, or resource constraints
- **Lack of Technology Roadmap:** No strategic planning for technology evolution and updates
- **Risk Aversion:** Fear that updating technologies will introduce instability or require extensive changes
- **Budget Constraints:** Limited resources allocated for technology modernization efforts
- **Knowledge Dependency:** Heavy reliance on developers with expertise in legacy technologies

## Detection Methods ○
- **Technology Audit:** Regular assessment of all components in the technology stack for currency and support status
- **Security Scanning:** Automated tools that identify known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies
- **Vendor Communication:** Monitor announcements about end-of-life dates for critical technologies
- **Developer Recruitment Metrics:** Track difficulty in finding qualified candidates for current technology stack
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare system performance with modern alternatives

## Examples

A financial services company runs a critical trading system built on a proprietary framework from the early 2000s. The framework vendor discontinued support five years ago, and there are no security updates available. The company cannot implement modern security practices like OAuth2 or encrypted communication protocols because the framework predates these standards. When they try to hire new developers, candidates are reluctant to work with obsolete technology, and existing developers struggle to integrate with modern financial APIs that expect current authentication methods. Another example involves a manufacturing company with an inventory management system built on a legacy database that doesn't support modern SQL standards. They cannot implement business intelligence tools or real-time analytics because their database lacks the features that contemporary reporting tools require. Simple queries that should take seconds require complex workarounds that take minutes to execute, severely limiting their ability to make data-driven decisions.
