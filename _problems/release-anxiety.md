## Description
Release anxiety is the feeling of stress and fear that developers experience when they are about to deploy a new version of their software. This is a common problem in organizations with a poor release process and a culture of blame. When releases are risky and failures are common, it is natural for developers to be anxious about them. This anxiety can have a negative impact on the team's morale and productivity. It can also lead to a reluctance to release new features, which can have a negative impact on the business.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team is visibly stressed and anxious on release day.
- There is a lot of finger-pointing and blame when things go wrong.
- The team is hesitant to take on risky tasks.
- There is a general lack of confidence in the release process.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The constant stress and pressure of releases can lead to exhaustion and demoralization.
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** The team's ability to deliver new features is hampered by their reluctance to release.
- **[Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md):** The team is hesitant to experiment and take risks for fear of failure.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Large, Risky Releases](large-risky-releases.md):** When releases are large and complex, they are more likely to fail, which can lead to release anxiety.
- **[Release Instability](release-instability.md):** A history of failed releases can make developers anxious about future releases.
- **[Fear of Conflict](fear-of-conflict.md):** A culture of blame can make people afraid to take risks.
- **Lack of Automated Tests:** Without a comprehensive suite of automated tests, it is difficult to have confidence in a release.
- **[Complex Deployment Process](complex-deployment-process.md):** A manual, time-consuming, and error-prone deployment process can increase the risk of failure and the anxiety of the team.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their feelings about the release process.
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss the team's feelings about releases in your retrospectives.
- **Release Day Behavior:** Observe the team's behavior on release day. Are they stressed and anxious?
- **Willingness to Release:** Is the team eager to release new features, or are they hesitant?

## Examples
A company has a culture of blame. When a release fails, the first question that is asked is, "Whose fault is it?" As a result, developers are afraid to take risks, and they are very anxious about releases. The company's release process is also very manual and error-prone, which only adds to the anxiety. The team has a long list of features that they would like to release, but they are afraid to do so for fear of failure.
