## Description

Implementation starts without design occurs when development teams begin coding immediately without first establishing a clear architectural vision, system structure, or detailed design. This rush to code often stems from time pressure, excitement to start building, or misconceptions about agile development practices. The result is systems that evolve organically without coherent structure, leading to code that is difficult to understand, maintain, and extend. This problem is particularly damaging in legacy modernization projects where the opportunity to establish better architecture is lost.

## Indicators ⟡

- Development work begins immediately after requirements gathering without design phases
- Architecture discussions happen during implementation rather than before
- No clear system structure or component boundaries defined upfront
- Database schemas created on-the-fly as development progresses
- API designs emerging organically rather than being planned
- Team members unsure about overall system architecture or design patterns
- Technology choices made individually by developers during implementation

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** Code structure that doesn't follow consistent patterns or principles
- **[Stagnant Architecture](stagnant-architecture.md):** Frequent architectural refactoring needed to accommodate new features
- **[Difficult Developer Onboarding](difficult-developer-onboarding.md):** Difficulty onboarding new developers due to unclear system organization
- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** Integration challenges between different parts of the system
- **[Slow Application Performance](slow-application-performance.md):** Performance issues that require fundamental structural changes
- **[Database Schema Design Problems](database-schema-design-problems.md):** Database designs that don't support efficient queries or data integrity
- **[Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md):** Code reviews that focus on architectural decisions rather than implementation details
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Accumulation of architectural debt from unplanned implementation decisions
- **[Poor Domain Model](poor-domain-model.md):** Domain concepts that are poorly represented in the code structure
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** System components that are tightly coupled due to lack of design
- **[Difficult to Test Code](difficult-to-test-code.md):** Code that is hard to test due to poor architectural boundaries
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Complex debugging due to unclear system structure and data flow
- **[Maintenance Overhead](maintenance-overhead.md):** High maintenance costs due to architectural complexity
- **[Slow Feature Development](slow-feature-development.md):** Development velocity degradation as system complexity increases

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Time pressure and unrealistic deadlines that discourage upfront design work
- **[Misunderstanding of OOP](misunderstanding-of-oop.md):** Misunderstanding of agile principles, believing that "working software" means skipping design
- **[Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md):** Lack of experienced architects or senior developers to guide design decisions
- **[Short-Term Focus](short-term-focus.md):** Organizational culture that values visible progress (code) over planning activities
- **[Fear of Failure](fear-of-failure.md):** Previous negative experiences with over-designed systems leading to design avoidance
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Insufficient understanding of system complexity and long-term maintenance costs
- **[Resource Allocation Failures](resource-allocation-failures.md):** Budget constraints that don't account for design and architecture activities
- **[Unrealistic Deadlines](unrealistic-deadlines.md):** Schedules that don't allow time for proper design phases
- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Lack of planning for architectural and design activities in project timelines
- **[Inexperienced Developers](inexperienced-developers.md):** Development teams without experience in architectural design
- **[Slow Knowledge Transfer](slow-knowledge-transfer.md):** No senior guidance for architectural decision-making
- **[Eager to Please Stakeholders](eager-to-please-stakeholders.md):** Pressure to show immediate coding progress to stakeholders
- **[Analysis Paralysis](analysis-paralysis.md):** Overreaction to previous analysis paralysis leading to insufficient design
- **[Cargo Culting](cargo-culting.md):** Copying implementation patterns without understanding underlying design principles
- **[CV Driven Development](cv-driven-development.md):** Individual preferences overriding systematic design approaches

## Detection Methods ○

- Review project timelines for allocation of design and architecture activities
- Examine code repositories for evidence of consistent architectural patterns
- Conduct architecture reviews early in the development process
- Monitor frequency of structural refactoring and architectural changes
- Assess team understanding of system structure through interviews or documentation reviews
- Review database schema evolution for signs of organic, unplanned growth
- Analyze code metrics for consistency in design patterns and structural organization

## Examples

A startup building a new SaaS platform immediately begins coding features after defining user stories, without designing the overall system architecture. Three months into development, they realize their data model can't efficiently support multi-tenancy, their API design makes mobile app integration difficult, and their authentication system can't scale to support enterprise customers. What started as rapid feature development becomes a series of major refactoring efforts, each requiring weeks of work and risking the introduction of bugs. The team spends more time restructuring existing code than building new features, and the originally tight timeline extends by months as they retrofit architectural decisions that should have been made upfront.
