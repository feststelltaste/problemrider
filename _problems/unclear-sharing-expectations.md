## Description
Unclear sharing expectations is a situation where it is not clear what information should be shared with the rest of the team. This is a common problem in teams that do not have a culture of knowledge sharing. Unclear sharing expectations can lead to a number of problems, including knowledge silos, poor communication, and team coordination issues.

## Indicators ⟡
- Team members are not sure what information they should share with the rest of the team.
- There is a lot of information that is not shared with the rest of the team.
- Team members are often surprised by information that they should have known about.
- There is a lot of duplicated effort as team members have to rediscover the same information.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** The knowledge remains in the heads of a few senior developers, and it is not shared with the rest of the team.
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** There is a lack of communication on the team because team members are not sure what information they should share.
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** The teams have difficulty coordinating their work because they do not have the information they need.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Developers get frustrated with the lack of information and the feeling that they are not able to do their jobs effectively.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** The team does not have a culture of knowledge sharing, so there are no clear expectations about what should be shared.
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** There is no communication plan in place, so it is not clear how information should be shared.
- **[Product Direction Chaos](product-direction-chaos.md):** There is no one on the team who is responsible for making sure that information is shared effectively.
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** The team is under pressure to deliver new features as quickly as possible, so they do not have time to share information.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they feel like they have the information they need to do their jobs.
- **Communication Audits:** Audit the communication channels to see what information is being shared.
- **Retrospectives:** Use retrospectives to identify what information is not being shared.

## Examples
A team is working on a new project. The team does not have a culture of knowledge sharing. There are no clear expectations about what information should be shared. As a result, the team members are not sure what information they should share with the rest of the team. This leads to a number of problems, including knowledge silos, poor communication, and team coordination issues.
