## Description

Stakeholder confidence loss occurs when business partners, customers, or management lose faith in the development team's ability to deliver projects on time, meet quality standards, or fulfill commitments. This erosion of trust creates a negative cycle where relationships become adversarial, communication decreases, and collaboration suffers, ultimately making successful project delivery even more difficult.

## Indicators ⟡

- Stakeholders express skepticism about development team capabilities or commitments
- Business partners make contingency plans that assume development delays
- Management scrutinizes development decisions more closely than previously
- Fewer collaborative planning sessions and more directive communications from stakeholders
- Stakeholders seek alternative solutions or vendors for future projects

## Symptoms ▲

- **Reduced Collaboration:** Stakeholders become less willing to work closely with development teams
- **[Planning Credibility Issues](planning-credibility-issues.md):** Development estimates and plans are questioned or overridden
- **Micromanagement:** Increased oversight and control from management due to trust concerns
- **Resource Restrictions:** Reduced budgets or resources allocated to development projects
- **Alternative Sourcing:** Stakeholders explore external vendors or alternative teams for critical projects

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Consistent failure to meet commitments erodes stakeholder trust
- **Quality Issues:** Delivered products don't meet expected quality standards or user needs
- **Communication Failures:** Poor communication about risks, progress, or challenges
- **Transparency Gaps:** Stakeholders don't understand why projects face difficulties or delays
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** Business performance declines attributed to development team performance
- **Expectation Misalignment:** Different expectations between development teams and stakeholders about what's realistic

## Detection Methods ○

- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Regular assessment of stakeholder confidence and satisfaction levels
- **Relationship Quality Analysis:** Monitor collaboration patterns and communication frequency with stakeholders
- **Project Approval Rates:** Track how often new projects are approved for the development team
- **Resource Allocation Trends:** Analyze whether development team resources are increasing or decreasing
- **Communication Pattern Analysis:** Evaluate changes in how stakeholders interact with development teams

## Examples

After three consecutive project delays that caused missed marketing launches and customer commitment failures, the VP of Sales stops including the development team in customer meetings and begins promising only features that are already completed. The marketing team creates campaigns with vague feature descriptions rather than specific functionality promises, and the business begins evaluating external development agencies for critical projects. Another example involves a development team whose last mobile app release had significant performance issues that caused customer churn. The product team now insists on extensive third-party testing before any release and requires weekly progress reports with detailed technical explanations, fundamentally changing the working relationship from collaborative to adversarial.
