## Description

Scope change resistance occurs when organizations or teams avoid making necessary modifications to project scope, requirements, or deliverables due to procedural barriers, contract constraints, or cultural resistance to change. This resistance can prevent projects from adapting to new information, changing business needs, or discovered requirements, potentially leading to delivery of solutions that don't meet actual needs.

## Indicators ⟡

- Necessary changes are identified but not implemented due to process barriers
- Teams continue with original scope despite evidence it won't meet current needs
- Change requests are discouraged or rejected without proper evaluation
- Contract terms prevent adaptation to new requirements or insights
- Stakeholders express concern about scope but changes aren't pursued

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** Final deliverables don't match actual business needs
- **[Suboptimal Solutions](suboptimal-solutions.md):** Solutions are compromised by inability to adapt scope
- **[Stakeholder Frustration](stakeholder-frustration.md):** Business stakeholders frustrated with inflexible project approach
- **[Wasted Development Effort](wasted-development-effort.md):** Work continues on solutions that won't provide intended value
- **Project Failure Risk:** Projects risk failure by not adapting to changing requirements

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Poor Contract Design](poor-contract-design.md):** Contract terms make scope changes difficult or expensive
- **Change Phobia:** Organizational culture strongly resists any modifications to established plans
- **Process Rigidity:** Change management processes are too complex or time-consuming
- **Budget Constraints:** No budget allocated for scope changes even when necessary
- **Fear of Blame:** Individuals avoid proposing changes due to fear of being blamed for "scope creep"

## Detection Methods ○

- **Scope Change Request Analysis:** Track what changes are requested versus what changes are approved
- **Requirement Evolution Tracking:** Monitor how requirements change over project lifecycle
- **Stakeholder Alignment Assessment:** Measure alignment between delivered scope and actual needs
- **Change Approval Rate:** Calculate percentage of proposed changes that are actually implemented
- **Post-Project Reviews:** Assess whether delivered solutions met evolving business needs

## Examples

A customer portal development project discovers through user testing that the original requirements don't match how customers actually want to interact with the system. However, the fixed-price contract makes any scope changes expensive and time-consuming to approve. Rather than adapt the solution to actual user needs, the team continues with the original scope, delivering a system that customers find difficult to use. Another example involves a data migration project where new data quality issues are discovered that weren't in the original scope. The project team avoids addressing these issues because change requests require extensive documentation and approval processes, resulting in a migration that doesn't fully meet data quality requirements.
