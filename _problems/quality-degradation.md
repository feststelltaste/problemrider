## Description

Quality degradation occurs when software systems experience a steady decline in reliability, maintainability, performance, or usability over time. This degradation typically results from accumulated technical debt, rushed development practices, insufficient testing, and a lack of systematic quality maintenance. Unlike isolated quality issues, this represents a systemic decline that affects multiple aspects of the system.

## Indicators ⟡

- Bug reports increase over time despite ongoing development effort
- System performance gradually decreases without clear cause
- Code becomes increasingly difficult to modify and understand
- User satisfaction with system reliability and usability decreases
- More time is spent on maintenance and bug fixes relative to new features

## Symptoms ▲

- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** New bugs appear frequently during development activities
- **User Dissatisfaction:** Users report declining system reliability and usability
- **[Maintenance Cost Increase](maintenance-cost-increase.md):** More resources required to maintain system functionality
- **[Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md):** Development becomes slower due to quality issues
- **[Release Instability](release-instability.md):** System becomes less stable and predictable over time

## Root Causes ▼

- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Accumulated shortcuts and compromises undermine system quality
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Constant pressure to deliver quickly prevents investment in quality
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** Inadequate testing practices allow quality issues to accumulate
- **[Short-Term Focus](short-term-focus.md):** No resources allocated to systematic quality improvement
- **[Short-Term Focus](short-term-focus.md):** Management prioritizes immediate delivery over long-term quality

## Detection Methods ○

- **Quality Trend Analysis:** Track quality metrics over time to identify degradation patterns
- **Bug Rate Monitoring:** Monitor bug discovery and resolution rates across releases
- **Performance Baseline Comparison:** Compare current performance against historical baselines
- **Code Quality Metrics:** Track code complexity, maintainability, and test coverage trends
- **User Satisfaction Surveys:** Regular assessment of user experience and satisfaction

## Examples

A customer relationship management system that worked well for two years begins experiencing frequent crashes, slow response times, and data inconsistencies. Investigation reveals that rapid feature additions without corresponding refactoring have created a complex, brittle codebase where small changes have unpredictable effects. The team spends 70% of their time fixing bugs and maintaining existing functionality rather than developing new features. Another example involves an e-commerce platform where checkout success rates gradually decline from 99% to 85% over six months due to accumulated integration issues, database performance problems, and unresolved edge cases that compound over time.
