## Description
Connection pools are a vital tool for managing database connections, but they can cause serious problems if they are not configured correctly. A misconfigured connection pool can lead to a variety of issues, from connection leaks and timeouts to a complete exhaustion of database resources. Common misconfigurations include setting the pool size too high or too low, using an inappropriate timeout value, or not properly handling connection validation. Proper tuning of the connection pool is essential for any application that relies on a database.

## Indicators ⟡
- You are seeing a high number of connection errors in your logs.
- Your application is slow, and you suspect that it is due to a high number of database connections.
- You are getting complaints from users about slow performance.
- You are seeing a high number of timeout errors in your logs.

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Incorrect Max Connection Pool Size](incorrect-max-connection-pool-size.md):** Applications report errors like "Connection pool exhausted" or "No available connections."
- **[High Connection Count](high-connection-count.md):** The database server shows a large number of open connections, many of which may be idle.
- **Slow Connection Establishment:** Applications take a long time to acquire a database connection.
- **Intermittent Application Errors:** Errors related to database connectivity appear sporadically, making them hard to diagnose.
- **Increased Database Load:** Even with a seemingly low application workload, the database might show higher-than-expected resource usage due to inefficient connection handling.

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Incorrect Max Connection Pool Size](incorrect-max-connection-pool-size.md):** The maximum number of connections in the pool is set too high (wasting database resources) or too low (leading to exhaustion).
- **Improper Idle Timeout:** Idle connections are kept open for too long, consuming resources, or closed too quickly, leading to frequent re-establishment.
- **No Connection Validation:** The pool does not validate connections before handing them out, leading to errors if the database has closed them.
- **Lack of Prepared Statement Caching:** Prepared statements are not cached, leading to repeated parsing and optimization by the database.
- **Application Not Releasing Connections:** Code errors prevent connections from being returned to the pool after use.
- **Transaction Management Issues:** Transactions are not properly committed or rolled back, holding connections open indefinitely.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Application Metrics:** Monitor connection pool metrics (e.g., active connections, idle connections, wait times, connection acquisition rates) provided by the application framework or a monitoring agent.
- **Database Monitoring Tools:** Observe the number of active and idle connections on the database server.
- **Log Analysis:** Look for connection-related errors in application and database logs.
- **Load Testing:** Simulate peak load to identify if the connection pool can handle the expected concurrency.

## Examples
A web application experiences frequent "connection pool exhausted" errors during peak traffic. Investigation reveals that the `max_pool_size` was set to 10, while the application regularly handles 50 concurrent requests, each requiring a database connection. In another case, a Spring Boot application uses HikariCP, but the `idleTimeout` is set to 30 minutes, while the database has a `wait_timeout` of 5 minutes. Connections are silently closed by the database, but the connection pool still thinks they are valid, leading to errors when the application tries to use them. This is a common problem in applications that interact with relational databases, especially in microservices architectures where many services might independently manage their own connection pools to the same database. Proper tuning is crucial for performance and stability.
