## Description

Unbounded data structures are collections, caches, logs, or other data containers that can grow without limit, eventually consuming all available memory or causing severe performance degradation. Unlike controlled data growth, unbounded structures lack mechanisms to limit their size, prune old data, or manage their resource consumption, making them a significant source of system instability in long-running applications.

## Indicators ⟡

- Data structures continuously grow in size without any size limits or cleanup mechanisms
- Memory usage increases proportionally with application runtime or data processing volume
- Performance degrades as data structure size increases due to linear search or poor algorithmic complexity
- System runs out of memory after processing large amounts of data over time
- Cache hit rates decrease as cache size grows beyond optimal limits

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Memory Leaks](memory-leaks.md):** Continuously growing data structures consume increasing amounts of memory
- **[Gradual Performance Degradation](gradual-performance-degradation.md):** Performance decreases as data structure operations become more expensive
- **[Unbounded Data Growth](unbounded-data-growth.md):** Data accumulates without corresponding cleanup or archival processes
- **System Resource Exhaustion:** Available memory or disk space is consumed by growing data structures
- **Application Responsiveness Issues:** Large data structures cause processing delays and user interface freezes

## Root Causes ▼

- **Missing Size Limits:** Data structures are implemented without maximum size constraints or overflow handling
- **Lack of Data Lifecycle Management:** No policies for when data should be removed, archived, or expired
- **Inadequate Cache Eviction:** Caching mechanisms lack proper eviction strategies like LRU, TTL, or size limits
- **Accumulating Debug Information:** Debug logs, audit trails, or diagnostic data accumulate without rotation
- **[Session Management Issues](session-management-issues.md):** User session data or temporary data structures grow without cleanup
- **Event Queue Buildup:** Event queues or message buffers accumulate messages faster than they can be processed

## Detection Methods ○

- **Memory Usage Monitoring:** Track memory consumption patterns over time to identify continuously growing structures
- **Data Structure Size Metrics:** Monitor the size of key data structures and collections in the application
- **Performance Profiling:** Analyze performance degradation patterns that correlate with data structure growth
- **Memory Heap Analysis:** Use heap dumps to identify large objects and data structures consuming significant memory
- **Cache Statistics:** Monitor cache sizes, hit rates, and eviction patterns
- **Resource Usage Trends:** Track long-term trends in memory, disk, and CPU usage

## Examples

An application maintains an in-memory cache of user preferences that never expires or limits its size. As new users register and existing users modify their preferences, the cache grows continuously, eventually consuming gigabytes of memory and causing the application to crash with out-of-memory errors. Another example involves a logging system that appends all application events to an in-memory list for real-time monitoring, but never rotates or clears old entries. After running for several months, the log list contains millions of entries that consume most of the available system memory and make log searching extremely slow.
