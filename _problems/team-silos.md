## Description
Team silos are a common organizational problem where different teams or individuals work in isolation from each other. This can lead to a number of problems, including duplicated effort, inconsistent solutions, and a lack of knowledge sharing. In a software development context, team silos can be particularly damaging. When developers don't communicate with each other, they are likely to solve the same problems in different ways, which can lead to a fragmented and inconsistent codebase. This can make the system more difficult to maintain and evolve over time. This problem leads to knowledge silos, single points of failure, and reduced team resilience. When severe, it can result in a "bus factor" of one, where the loss of a single team member would be catastrophic to the project.

## Indicators ⟡
- Different teams are working on similar features without any coordination.
- There is a lack of awareness of what other teams are working on.
- Knowledge is concentrated in a few key individuals, and it is not being shared with the rest of the team.
- There is a sense of "us versus them" between different teams.
- The team does not have a culture of knowledge sharing.
- The team is not using any tools to facilitate knowledge sharing.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** Different parts of the system are built using different technologies, patterns, and standards.
- **[Code Duplication](code-duplication.md):** The same functionality is implemented in multiple places by different teams.
- **[Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md):** The lack of collaboration and knowledge sharing can stifle creativity and innovation.
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** The need to reinvent the wheel and the lack of reusable components can slow down the pace of development.
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Only a few individuals understand critical parts of the system, creating single points of failure.
- **Repetitive Mistakes:** Teams or individuals repeatedly make the same errors because lessons learned are not shared across the team.
- **[Difficult Developer Onboarding](difficult-developer-onboarding.md):** New team members struggle to get up to speed due to a lack of documented knowledge or accessible experts, taking significantly longer to become productive.
- **[Knowledge Dependency](knowledge-dependency.md):** Project progress grinds to a halt when a key person is unavailable (e.g., on vacation, leaves the company).

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Organizational Structure Mismatch](organizational-structure-mismatch.md):** A rigid, hierarchical organizational structure can encourage the formation of team silos.
- **Geographical Distribution:** When teams are located in different geographical locations, it can be more difficult for them to communicate and collaborate.
- **Lack of a Shared Vision:** When there is no clear, shared vision for the product, different teams are likely to pull in different directions.
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** A lack of effective communication channels and practices can make it difficult for teams to stay in sync.
- **Competition Between Teams:** A culture of competition between teams can discourage collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- **Lack of Dedicated Time:** Teams are too focused on feature delivery to allocate time for knowledge sharing activities.
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** Knowledge is not documented, or existing documentation is outdated, inaccessible, or poorly organized.
- **Cultural Barriers:** A culture that discourages asking questions, promotes individual heroism over collaboration, or lacks psychological safety.
- **[Overworked Teams](overworked-teams.md):** Overworked teams have little capacity for proactive knowledge sharing.
- **Lack of Tools/Platforms:** Absence of effective platforms for sharing, storing, and retrieving knowledge.
- **Fear of Redundancy:** Individuals may subconsciously hoard knowledge, fearing that sharing it will make them less valuable.
- **Lack of Formal Processes:** There are no structured mechanisms for knowledge transfer (e.g., regular tech talks, pair programming, mentorship programs).

## Detection Methods ○
- **Organizational Network Analysis:** Analyze the communication patterns within the organization to identify teams that are isolated from each other.
- **Codebase Analysis:** Look for signs of team silos in the codebase, such as inconsistent coding styles, duplicated functionality, and a lack of reusable components.
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers about their experience with collaboration and knowledge sharing. Their feedback can be a valuable source of information.
- **Cross-Team Retrospectives:** Hold retrospectives that bring together members of different teams to discuss their experiences and identify opportunities for improvement.
- **Bus Factor Analysis:** Identify critical components or systems understood by only one or two people. Assess how many critical individuals, if removed, would severely impact the project.
- **Onboarding Time Metrics:** Track how long it takes for new hires to become fully productive.
- **Code Review Observations:** Notice if reviewers frequently explain fundamental concepts or patterns that should be common knowledge.
- **Post-Mortems/Retrospectives:** Analyze if recurring issues could have been prevented by better knowledge sharing.

## Examples
A large enterprise has two different teams working on its e-commerce website. One team is responsible for the front-end, and the other team is responsible for the back-end. The two teams are located in different buildings, and they rarely communicate with each other. As a result, the front-end and back-end of the website are poorly integrated, and there are a number of inconsistencies in the user experience. The company is also paying for two different teams to solve the same problems, which is a waste of resources.

A critical legacy system is maintained by a single senior engineer. When this engineer goes on vacation, a major bug emerges, and no one else on the team has enough knowledge to quickly diagnose and fix it, leading to prolonged downtime. In another case, two different teams within the same organization independently develop similar microservices, each solving common problems like authentication and logging from scratch, unaware of the other's work or existing internal libraries.
