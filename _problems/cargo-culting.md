## Description

Cargo culting represents a pervasive anti-pattern in software development where teams blindly adopt practices, technologies, or architectural patterns without critical evaluation. This phenomenon stems from a superficial understanding that prioritizes mimicry over comprehension, leading to solutions that appear sophisticated but fundamentally misalign with the organization's unique context and requirements. The term originates from Pacific Island cultures that mimicked Western practices after World War II, serving as a powerful metaphor for uncritical technological imitation.

## Indicators ⟡
- Team members frequently reference "best practices" without explaining the reasoning behind them
- Adoption of new technologies or patterns immediately after they gain popularity without evaluation
- Copy-pasting code solutions from Stack Overflow or tutorials without modification
- Implementing design patterns or architectural styles because "that's how successful companies do it"
- Following process ceremonies or methodologies without understanding their purpose
- Team cannot explain why certain practices or tools were chosen beyond "it's recommended"
- Resistance to questioning or modifying adopted practices even when they don't fit the context

## Symptoms ▲

- **[High Maintenance Costs](high-maintenance-costs.md):** Unnecessary complexity creating maintenance challenges
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** Inconsistent application of patterns or practices across the codebase
- **[Slow Application Performance](slow-application-performance.md):** Performance problems from inappropriate technology choices
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Difficulty debugging issues in copied code
- **[Gold Plating](gold-plating.md):** Over-complex solutions that don't match the problem complexity
- **[Implementation Rework](implementation-rework.md):** Constant major refactoring of recently implemented features
- **[Difficult to Understand Code](difficult-to-understand-code.md):** Solutions that work but nobody understands how or why
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** Team struggles to modify or extend copied solutions
- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** Mismatched expectations between what the practice should deliver and actual results
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Technical debt from implementing patterns without understanding their purpose
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Development slowdown from working with inappropriate architectural choices
- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** Problems integrating copied solutions with existing systems

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Insufficient understanding of software engineering principles
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Pressure to deliver quickly without time for proper research and analysis
- **[Decision Avoidance](decision-avoidance.md):** Anxiety about making wrong technical decisions leading to copying "proven" solutions
- **[Slow Knowledge Transfer](slow-knowledge-transfer.md):** Lack of senior guidance during decision-making
- **[Constant Firefighting](constant-firefighting.md):** Culture that values speed of implementation over understanding
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** Poor documentation of decision rationale in the organization
- **[Inexperienced Developers](inexperienced-developers.md):** Minimal exposure to consequences of different architectural choices
- **[Copy-Paste Programming](copy-paste-programming.md):** Uncritical evaluation of external references
- **[Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md):** Lack of investment in team learning and skill development
- **[Fear of Failure](fear-of-failure.md):** Risk aversion that leads to copying "safe" solutions
- **[CV Driven Development](cv-driven-development.md):** Adopting trendy technologies for resume building rather than problem solving
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Lack of discussion about why certain approaches are chosen
- **[Implementation Starts Without Design](implementation-starts-without-design.md):** Beginning development without proper analysis of requirements

## Detection Methods ○
- **Why Interviews:** Conduct interviews asking team members to explain the reasoning behind technical choices
- **Decision Documentation:** Review decision records to verify rationale beyond external references
- **Code Complexity Analysis:** Identify overly complex patterns that don't match the problem's complexity
- **Performance Monitoring:** Track performance metrics after implementing new technologies
- **Pattern Consistency Checks:** Verify consistent implementation of patterns across the system
- **Source Tracing:** Identify code directly copied from tutorials without meaningful adaptation
- **Modification Difficulty:** Note areas where the team struggles to modify existing solutions
- **Trend Analysis:** Compare technology adoption against broader industry trends
- **Troubleshooting Assessment:** Evaluate the team's ability to independently resolve issues in adopted solutions

## Examples

A development team reads about microservices architecture being used successfully at large tech companies and decides to break their monolithic application into dozens of small services. However, they don't have the operational infrastructure, team size, or organizational structure to support microservices effectively. The result is a distributed monolith with all the complexity of microservices but none of the benefits. Network latency increases, debugging becomes much harder, and deployment complexity multiplies. When asked why they chose this approach, the team can only point to blog posts from major tech companies, without being able to articulate how their context differs or what specific problems they were trying to solve with the architectural change.
