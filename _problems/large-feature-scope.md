## Description
Large feature scope is a problem that occurs when a feature is too large and complex to be developed and delivered in a single, short iteration. This can lead to a number of problems, including long-lived feature branches, a lack of visibility into the progress of the feature, and a high risk of integration problems. Breaking down large features into smaller, more manageable chunks is a key principle of agile development, and it is essential for reducing risk and delivering value to users more quickly.

## Indicators ⟡
- Features are consistently taking longer to develop than expected.
- The team is frequently dealing with merge conflicts and integration problems.
- There is a lack of visibility into the progress of a feature.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Long-Lived Feature Branches](long-lived-feature-branches.md): The feature is developed on a separate branch for an extended period of time.
- [High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md): The complexity of the feature leads to a high level of technical debt.
- **Delayed Feedback:** The team does not get feedback on the feature until it is fully developed, which can be weeks or even months after the work has started.
- **Increased Risk:** The longer a feature is in development, the higher the risk of it not meeting user needs or having significant integration problems.

## Root Causes ▼
- **Lack of a Clear Product Vision:** The team does not have a clear understanding of the problem they are trying to solve, which leads to a bloated and overly complex feature.
- **No Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Mindset:** The team is trying to build the entire feature at once, rather than starting with a small, simple version and iterating on it over time.
- **Poor Planning:** The team did not adequately plan the feature and break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Track Feature Lead Time:** Monitor the time it takes to develop and deliver a feature, from the initial idea to the final release.
- **Analyze Branching Strategy:** Look for long-lived feature branches in the version control system.
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss the challenges the team is facing with large features and identify ways to break them down into smaller pieces.

## Examples
A team is tasked with building a new reporting module for an application. The module is very complex and has a large number of features. The team decides to build the entire module on a single feature branch. The development takes several months, and when the team is finally ready to merge the branch, they are faced with a massive number of merge conflicts and integration problems. It takes them several more weeks to resolve the issues and release the feature. This is a classic example of how a large feature scope can lead to significant delays and a high level of risk.
