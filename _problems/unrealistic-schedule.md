## Description

Unrealistic schedules occur when project timelines are set based on wishful thinking, external pressure, or inadequate understanding of the actual work required rather than careful estimation and planning. These schedules typically underestimate complexity, ignore dependencies, fail to account for risks, and assume everything will go perfectly. The result is chronic schedule pressure that forces teams to take shortcuts, work excessive hours, and compromise quality.

## Indicators ⟡

- Estimated completion times are significantly shorter than historical data for similar work
- Schedules have no buffer time for unexpected issues or rework
- Timeline is dictated by external deadlines rather than realistic work estimates
- Team members consistently express concern that deadlines are impossible to meet
- Similar projects in the past have consistently exceeded their scheduled timelines

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Constant pressure to work faster and skip important steps
- **[Increased Technical Shortcuts](increased-technical-shortcuts.md):** Quality is sacrificed to meet unrealistic deadlines
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team members experience high stress and exhaustion
- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Project consistently fails to meet scheduled milestones
- **[Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md):** Quality suffers as team rushes to meet deadlines

## Root Causes ▼

- **Optimism Bias:** Tendency to underestimate effort and overestimate team capability
- **External Pressure:** Business or market pressure drives unrealistic deadline demands
- **Inadequate Estimation Skills:** Team lacks experience or training in realistic effort estimation
- **Political Pressure:** Schedules are set to satisfy stakeholders rather than reflect reality
- **Lack of Historical Data:** No data from previous projects to inform realistic estimates

## Detection Methods ○

- **Estimation Accuracy Analysis:** Compare actual completion times with original estimates
- **Team Stress Level Monitoring:** Regular surveys about workload and schedule pressure
- **Velocity Tracking:** Monitor team productivity over time to identify unsustainable pace
- **Schedule Variance Reporting:** Track deviations from planned schedules across projects
- **Quality Metrics Correlation:** Analyze relationship between schedule pressure and defect rates

## Examples

A mobile application project is given a four-month deadline because the business wants to launch before a major industry conference. However, the development team estimates the work will take at least eight months based on the feature requirements and their past experience with similar applications. Management insists the four-month deadline is non-negotiable due to competitive pressure. The team is forced to work nights and weekends, skip code reviews, eliminate automated testing, and implement features with minimal error handling. The application launches on time but is plagued with crashes, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities that damage the company's reputation and require six months of additional work to fix. Another example involves a database migration project where the schedule allows only two weeks for testing because the business needs the new system operational by the end of the fiscal quarter. The complexity of migrating five years of customer data is severely underestimated, and testing reveals numerous data integrity issues. The team is forced to choose between delaying the migration (missing the business deadline) or proceeding with known data problems, ultimately leading to customer service issues and emergency fixes that cost more than the original project.
