## Description

Service discovery failures occur when distributed systems cannot reliably locate and connect to required services, leading to communication breakdowns and system instability. This affects microservices architectures, cloud-native applications, and any system relying on dynamic service registration and discovery mechanisms. Failed service discovery can cascade through dependent services, causing widespread system failures.

## Indicators ⟡

- Services report "service not found" or connection timeout errors
- Intermittent failures in service-to-service communication
- Load balancers cannot route traffic to healthy service instances
- Service registry shows stale or incorrect service information
- Applications cannot bootstrap due to missing service dependencies

## Symptoms ▲

- **Service Communication Failures:** Services cannot establish connections to required dependencies
- **Stale Service Information:** Service registry contains outdated location information
- **Load Balancing Issues:** Traffic routed to unavailable or unhealthy service instances
- **Bootstrap Failures:** Applications fail to start due to unresolvable service dependencies
- **Cascading Service Failures:** Service discovery failures propagate through dependent services

## Root Causes ▼

- **Service Registry Inconsistency:** Service registry contains stale or incorrect service location data
- **Network Partitioning:** Network issues preventing communication with service discovery infrastructure
- **DNS Resolution Problems:** DNS-based service discovery failing due to DNS server issues
- **Service Health Check Failures:** Health checks not accurately reflecting service availability
- **Configuration Drift:** Service discovery configuration becoming inconsistent across environments
- **Registry Scaling Issues:** Service discovery infrastructure cannot handle the load

## Detection Methods ○

- **Service Discovery Monitoring:** Monitor service registry health and response times
- **Service Resolution Testing:** Regularly test service name resolution across the system
- **Health Check Validation:** Verify that health checks accurately reflect service status
- **Network Connectivity Testing:** Test network paths between services and discovery infrastructure
- **Registry Consistency Auditing:** Audit service registry data for consistency and accuracy

## Examples

A microservices e-commerce platform uses Consul for service discovery, but network latency causes service registrations to timeout, leaving the registry with stale information. When payment services try to connect to inventory services, they receive outdated IP addresses of terminated instances, causing checkout failures. Implementing retry logic and health check improvements resolves the discovery reliability issues. Another example involves a Kubernetes cluster where DNS-based service discovery fails intermittently due to DNS server overload. Applications experience random connection failures when resolving service names, particularly during high traffic periods. Scaling the DNS infrastructure and implementing DNS caching reduces discovery failures by 95%.
