## Description

Poor interfaces between applications occur when systems communicate through poorly designed, inconsistent, or inadequately documented integration points. This creates fragile connections that are prone to failures, data inconsistencies, and maintenance challenges. The problem is particularly acute in enterprise environments with multiple legacy systems that evolved independently, requiring complex integration patterns that become increasingly difficult to maintain and extend over time.

## Indicators ⟡

- Integration projects that consistently take longer than estimated
- Multiple different integration patterns used across the same organization
- Lack of standardized API documentation or interface specifications
- Integration logic scattered throughout application codebases rather than centralized
- Frequent discussions about data synchronization issues between systems
- Teams avoiding integration work due to complexity and unreliability
- New system integrations requiring custom, one-off solutions

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Cross-System Data Synchronization Problems](cross-system-data-synchronization-problems.md):** Frequent data synchronization failures between systems
- **[High Maintenance Costs](high-maintenance-costs.md):** High maintenance overhead for existing integrations
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** Integration points that break when individual systems are updated
- **[Inconsistent Behavior](inconsistent-behavior.md):** Inconsistent data representations across different applications
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Long debugging sessions when integration problems occur
- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** Difficulty adding new systems to the existing ecosystem
- **[Slow Application Performance](slow-application-performance.md):** Performance issues caused by inefficient data exchange patterns
- **[Increased Manual Work](increased-manual-work.md):** Manual intervention required to resolve integration issues
- **[Operational Overhead](operational-overhead.md):** Significant time spent maintaining fragile integration points
- **[Data Migration Integrity Issues](data-migration-integrity-issues.md):** Data corruption or loss during system-to-system transfers
- **[Cascade Failures](cascade-failures.md):** Failures in one system causing problems in dependent systems
- **[Service Timeouts](service-timeouts.md):** Integration timeouts due to poor interface design
- **[High Database Resource Utilization](high-database-resource-utilization.md):** Database performance issues from inefficient integration queries
- **[Technology Stack Fragmentation](technology-stack-fragmentation.md):** Multiple incompatible integration approaches across the organization

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Lack of enterprise integration architecture and governance
- **[Team Silos](team-silos.md):** Systems designed in isolation without considering integration requirements
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Technical debt from legacy integrations that were never properly designed
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Insufficient expertise in integration patterns and best practices
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Time pressure leading to quick-fix integration solutions
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Poor communication between teams responsible for different systems
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** Absence of standardized data formats and communication protocols
- **[Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md):** Inadequate tooling and infrastructure for managing integrations
- **[Implementation Starts Without Design](implementation-starts-without-design.md):** Building integrations without proper interface design
- **[Short-Term Focus](short-term-focus.md):** Prioritizing quick integration over long-term maintainability
- **[Obsolete Technologies](obsolete-technologies.md):** Legacy systems with outdated integration capabilities
- **[Insufficient Design Skills](insufficient-design-skills.md):** Lack of expertise in designing robust API interfaces
- **[Poor Encapsulation](poor-encapsulation.md):** Tight coupling between systems through poorly designed interfaces
- **[Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md):** Architectural limitations that make clean integration difficult

## Detection Methods ○

- Audit existing integration patterns and identify inconsistencies
- Monitor integration failure rates and error patterns
- Review integration documentation quality and completeness
- Analyze time spent on integration-related maintenance and debugging
- Survey development teams about integration pain points and challenges
- Examine data quality issues that stem from integration problems
- Review system dependency maps for overly complex or fragile connections
- Assess integration testing coverage and reliability

## Examples

A manufacturing company has separate systems for inventory management, order processing, and financial reporting, each developed by different teams over several years. The inventory system exposes data through direct database access, the order system uses REST APIs but with inconsistent error handling, and the financial system expects data via nightly batch file transfers. When an order is processed, inventory updates sometimes fail silently, leading to overselling. Financial reports often show discrepancies because batch transfers occasionally fail without notification. Adding a new customer portal requires integrating with all three systems, but each integration requires different approaches, error handling strategies, and data transformation logic, turning a simple project into a complex, month-long integration effort.
