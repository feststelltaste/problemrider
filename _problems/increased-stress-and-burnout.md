## Description

Increased stress and burnout occurs when team members experience sustained high levels of work-related stress that leads to physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion. This problem goes beyond normal work pressure and represents a chronic condition that affects individual performance, team dynamics, and overall system quality. The stress often stems from unrealistic expectations, poor work conditions, or systemic organizational problems.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members frequently mention feeling overwhelmed or stressed
- Increased sick days, mental health days, or requests for time off
- Visible signs of fatigue, irritability, or disengagement during work
- Team members work excessive hours regularly to meet expectations
- Productivity and code quality decline despite increased effort

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team members experience chronic exhaustion and disengagement
- **Decreased Performance:** Individual and team productivity declines despite working longer hours
- **[High Turnover](high-turnover.md):** Team members leave to escape stressful working conditions
- **Health Issues:** Team members experience stress-related health problems
- **Reduced Collaboration:** Team cohesion and communication suffer under stress

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Constant pressure to deliver faster than sustainable pace allows
- **[Unrealistic Deadlines](unrealistic-deadlines.md):** Impossible timeline expectations create chronic stress
- **Workload Imbalance:** Individual team members carry disproportionate responsibility or workload
- **Lack of Control:** Team members feel powerless to influence their work conditions or priorities
- **Poor Work-Life Balance:** Work demands consistently interfere with personal time and activities
- **Organizational Culture:** Company culture that normalizes overwork and high stress levels

## Detection Methods ○

- **Stress Level Surveys:** Regular anonymous surveys about team member stress and satisfaction levels
- **Work Hour Tracking:** Monitor actual hours worked compared to planned schedules
- **Health and Wellness Metrics:** Track sick days, stress-related absences, and wellness program usage
- **Performance Correlation Analysis:** Analyze correlation between stress indicators and work quality
- **Exit Interview Analysis:** Understand stress-related factors in team member departures

## Examples

A development team consistently works 60-hour weeks to meet quarterly release deadlines, with team members skipping vacations and working weekends to deliver features on time. Three team members develop stress-related health issues including insomnia and anxiety, and two resign citing burnout and work-life balance concerns. Code quality begins declining as the remaining team members make more mistakes due to fatigue and mental exhaustion. Another example involves a support team that handles both development work and production incidents, with team members being on-call 24/7 and frequently interrupted during development work to handle urgent issues, creating chronic stress from never being able to focus on planned work or have predictable schedules.
