## Description
Reviewer inexperience occurs when team members tasked with code review do not have the necessary skills or knowledge to provide deep, insightful feedback. This often leads to reviews that are either overly focused on trivial stylistic issues or are simply rubber-stamped without a thorough analysis of the code's logic, architecture, or potential edge cases. This can create a false sense of security and allow critical issues to slip into the codebase.

## Indicators ⟡
- Code reviews from certain team members are consistently brief and lack substantive comments.
- Junior developers are assigned to review complex changes without guidance from senior team members.
- There is no formal training or mentorship program for improving code review skills.

## Symptoms ▲
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md): Reviews focus on minor issues rather than significant problems.
- [Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md): Critical bugs, design flaws, and performance issues are missed.
- [Bikeshedding](bikeshedding.md): Reviewers focus on trivial details they understand, avoiding complex parts of the code.
- **Decreased Code Quality:** The overall quality of the codebase declines as a result of ineffective reviews.

## Root Causes ▼
- **Lack of Training:** The organization does not invest in training developers on how to perform effective code reviews.
- **No Mentorship:** Senior developers do not actively mentor junior developers on review best practices.
- **Time Pressure:** Reviewers are rushed and do not have adequate time to conduct a thorough review, falling back on their limited experience.
- **Unclear Expectations:** There are no clear guidelines or checklists for what to look for during a code review.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Analyze Review Comments:** Look for patterns of superficial or non-substantive comments from specific reviewers.
- **Track Bug Origins:** Trace production bugs back to the code changes that introduced them and examine the corresponding code reviews.
- **Team Skills Assessment:** Evaluate the overall experience level of the team and identify any knowledge gaps.

## Examples
A junior developer is asked to review a pull request that involves complex database queries. Lacking experience in this area, they focus on code formatting and variable naming, and approve the pull request. The inefficient queries are only discovered later when they cause a performance bottleneck in production. This scenario highlights how inexperience can undermine the effectiveness of code reviews as a quality gate.
