## Description
Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalizing it. It is often learned through experience, and it is often difficult to articulate. Tacit knowledge can be a major problem in software development, as it can lead to knowledge silos and a slowdown in knowledge transfer.

## Indicators ⟡
- There is a lot of knowledge that is not written down.
- New team members have a difficult time getting up to speed.
- The team is heavily reliant on a few senior developers.
- There is a lot of duplicated effort as new team members have to rediscover the same information.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** The knowledge remains in the heads of a few senior developers, and it is not shared with the rest of the team.
- **[Slow Knowledge Transfer](slow-knowledge-transfer.md):** It takes a long time for new team members to become productive because they have to learn all the tacit knowledge on their own.
- **[Inadequate Onboarding](inadequate-onboarding.md):** There is no formal onboarding process for new team members, so they have to learn all the tacit knowledge on their own.
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** The number of bugs is increasing because new team members do not have the tacit knowledge to write high-quality code.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** There is no documentation to help new team members get up to speed.
- **[Slow Knowledge Transfer](slow-knowledge-transfer.md):** There is no one to help new team members get up to speed.
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** The team does not have a culture of knowledge sharing, so people are not willing to share their tacit knowledge.
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** The team is under pressure to deliver new features as quickly as possible, so they do not have time to document their tacit knowledge.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask developers if they feel like they have the knowledge they need to do their jobs.
- **Code Reviews:** Look for code that is difficult to understand.
- **Pair Programming:** Use pair programming to help new team members learn the tacit knowledge of the team.

## Examples
A company has a legacy system that was written by a single developer who has since left the company. The developer did not write any documentation, so all the knowledge about the system is tacit knowledge. The new developers who are responsible for maintaining the system have a very difficult time getting up to speed. They are constantly making mistakes, and the number of bugs is increasing. This is a common problem in companies that do not have a culture of knowledge sharing.
