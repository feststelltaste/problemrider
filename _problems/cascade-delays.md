## Description

Cascade delays occur when delays in one project or work stream trigger delays in other dependent projects, creating a domino effect that amplifies the impact of initial schedule slips. This problem is particularly severe in organizations with complex project interdependencies, where one team's delayed deliverable can block multiple other teams and projects, multiplying the business impact of the original delay.

## Indicators ⟡

- Single project delays affect multiple other projects or teams
- Project schedules across the organization are frequently adjusted due to dependency delays
- Teams are frequently blocked waiting for deliverables from other teams
- Release schedules must be coordinated across multiple dependent projects
- Delays compound and grow larger as they propagate through dependent work

## Symptoms ▲

- **Organizational Delivery Paralysis:** Multiple projects are blocked simultaneously due to cascading delays
- **[Resource Allocation Failures](resource-allocation-failures.md):** Teams remain idle or work on lower-priority tasks while waiting for dependencies
- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Deadline misses multiply across dependent projects
- **[Stakeholder Confidence Loss](stakeholder-confidence-loss.md):** Business impact is magnified as multiple initiatives and thus stakeholders are affected
- **[Planning Credibility Issues](planning-credibility-issues.md):** Project planning becomes viewed as unreliable due to frequent cascade effects

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Missed Deadlines](missed-deadlines.md):** Initial delays in upstream dependencies trigger cascading effects
- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Inadequate planning fails to account for dependency risks and buffers
- **Tight Coupling Between Projects:** Projects are designed with minimal buffers between dependent phases

- **[Resource Contention](resource-contention.md):** Same resources are allocated to multiple dependent projects simultaneously
- **[Single Points of Failure](single-points-of-failure.md):** Single points of failure in project dependency chains

## Detection Methods ○

- **Dependency Impact Analysis:** Track how delays in one project affect other projects
- **Critical Path Analysis:** Identify project dependency chains and potential bottlenecks
- **Delay Propagation Tracking:** Monitor how initial delays spread through the organization
- **Resource Utilization Analysis:** Measure idle time caused by dependency delays
- **Stakeholder Impact Assessment:** Evaluate business impact of cascading project delays

## Examples

A mobile app release depends on a new API being delivered by the backend team, which depends on database schema changes from the infrastructure team. When the infrastructure team encounters unexpected compliance requirements that delay their work by 3 weeks, the backend team must delay their API work, which forces the mobile team to postpone their release. A marketing campaign tied to the app release must also be delayed, and a business partnership announcement dependent on the app functionality is pushed to the next quarter, turning a 3-week technical delay into a significant business impact. Another example involves an e-commerce platform where the checkout team's delayed payment integration blocks the inventory team's new fulfillment process, which blocks the customer service team's new order management tools, ultimately delaying a major product launch that was coordinated across all three areas.
