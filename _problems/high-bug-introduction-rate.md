## Description
A high bug introduction rate means that for every new feature or fix, a significant number of new bugs are created. This is a strong indicator of a fragile and unhealthy codebase. It slows down development, erodes confidence in the software, and increases the cost of maintenance. This problem is often a symptom of deeper issues in the development process and code quality.

## Indicators ⟡
- The number of bug reports increases after each release.
- Developers spend more time fixing new bugs than building new features.
- The "bugs" column on the team's Kanban board is always full.
- There is a sense of "one step forward, two steps back" in the development process.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** The team's focus is constantly diverted to fixing new issues, slowing down progress on planned work.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Constant firefighting and the inability to make progress can be demoralizing for the development team.
- **[Declining Business Metrics](declining-business-metrics.md):** Frequent bugs in new releases can damage the trust of users and stakeholders.
- **[Increased Cost of Development](increased-cost-of-development.md):** The cost of fixing bugs is significantly higher than preventing them in the first place.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** The existing code is difficult to change without introducing new defects.
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** The testing process is not thorough enough to catch bugs before they reach production.
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** The absence of a comprehensive automated test suite means that regressions are not caught early.
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** The code is difficult to understand, making it easy to introduce bugs.
- **[Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md):** The code review process is not effective at identifying potential issues.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Bug Tracking Metrics:** Monitor the number of new bugs reported after each release.
- **Code Churn Analysis:** Analyze the number of times a file is changed. High churn can indicate problematic areas.
- **Developer Feedback:** Regularly solicit feedback from the development team about the quality of the codebase and the development process.

## Examples
A team releases a new version of their software with a few new features. Within a week, the number of bug reports from users has doubled. The team spends the next two sprints fixing these new bugs, delaying the start of the next planned features. This cycle repeats with every release, leading to a slow and unpredictable development process.
