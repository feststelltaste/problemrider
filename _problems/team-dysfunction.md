## Description

Team dysfunction occurs when structural, cultural, or interpersonal problems prevent team members from working together effectively toward common goals. This manifests as conflicts, lack of trust, competing priorities, or systemic issues that make collaboration difficult or counterproductive. Unlike simple communication problems, team dysfunction represents deeper issues in how the team operates, makes decisions, and supports its members in achieving shared objectives.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members frequently work in isolation rather than collaborating
- Conflicts arise regularly and are not resolved constructively
- Team decisions are difficult to make or frequently reversed
- Individual goals conflict with team objectives
- Trust between team members is low or deteriorating

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Team members cannot effectively share information or coordinate work
- **[Blame Culture](blame-culture.md):** Problems are attributed to individuals rather than addressed systemically
- **[Individual Recognition Culture](individual-recognition-culture.md):** Rewards focus on individual achievements over team success
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** Unable to align work and priorities effectively
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Information hoarding due to competitive rather than collaborative dynamics
- **[High Turnover](high-turnover.md):** Team members leave due to dysfunctional work environment

## Root Causes ▼

- **Misaligned Incentives:** Individual performance metrics conflict with team collaboration
- **Role Ambiguity:** Unclear responsibilities create conflicts and gaps in accountability
- **Resource Competition:** Team members compete for limited resources rather than collaborating
- **Leadership Problems:** Management fails to model collaborative behavior or resolve conflicts
- **Skill Imbalances:** Significant disparities in abilities create tension and dependency issues
- **Cultural Mismatches:** Team members have fundamentally different approaches to work and collaboration
- **Conflicting Priorities:** Different team members are optimizing for different objectives
- **Trust Deficits:** Past conflicts or failures have damaged relationships between team members

## Detection Methods ○

- **Team Health Assessments:** Survey team members about collaboration, trust, and satisfaction
- **Conflict Frequency Analysis:** Track how often interpersonal or work conflicts arise
- **Collaboration Pattern Observation:** Monitor whether team members naturally work together or in isolation
- **Decision-Making Effectiveness:** Evaluate how well the team makes and executes collective decisions
- **Goal Alignment Assessment:** Determine whether team members are working toward compatible objectives
- **Retention Analysis:** Track team member satisfaction and turnover rates

## Examples

A software development team has individual performance reviews that emphasize personal contribution metrics like lines of code written or features completed, creating competition between developers rather than collaboration. When one developer discovers a complex bug that requires team-wide architectural changes, they implement a local workaround instead of raising the issue because fixing it would require significant collaboration without individual credit. This leads to accumulating technical debt and system fragility. Another example involves a team where senior developers hoard knowledge and resist mentoring junior members because they fear being replaced or losing their status as the "expert." This creates a toxic dynamic where junior developers struggle without support, senior developers become overloaded with all complex work, and the team cannot scale or improve its collective capabilities.
