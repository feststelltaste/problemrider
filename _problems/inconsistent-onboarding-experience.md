## Description

Inconsistent onboarding experience occurs when new team members receive dramatically different quality and depth of support during their initial period with the team. Some new hires may receive comprehensive guidance, structured learning paths, and regular check-ins, while others in the same team might struggle with minimal support and ad-hoc help. This inconsistency creates unequal outcomes where some team members become productive quickly while others struggle for months.

## Indicators ⟡

- New hires starting at the same time have vastly different productivity levels after a few months
- Some new team members receive structured training while others learn through trial and error
- Onboarding quality depends heavily on which experienced developer is available
- New hires express different levels of satisfaction with their initial experience
- Time to productivity varies dramatically between new team members with similar backgrounds

## Symptoms ▲

- **[New Hire Frustration](new-hire-frustration.md):** Some new developers feel unsupported compared to their better-mentored colleagues
- **Uneven Team Performance:** Team members who received poor onboarding remain less productive long-term
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Some team members miss critical information that others received during onboarding
- **Team Cohesion Issues:** Differences in onboarding experience create perceived unfairness within the team
- **Extended Onboarding Period:** Some new hires take much longer to reach productivity due to inadequate initial support

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Inadequate Mentoring Structure](inadequate-mentoring-structure.md):** No systematic approach to ensure consistent mentoring quality
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical information is held by specific individuals who may not be available
- **Resource Availability Variance:** Experienced team members have different availability to support new hires
- **Lack of Standardized Process:** No documented onboarding checklist or process to ensure consistency
- **Individual Mentoring Styles:** Different mentors have vastly different approaches and effectiveness

## Detection Methods ○

- **Onboarding Outcome Tracking:** Compare productivity metrics and satisfaction scores across new hires
- **New Hire Experience Surveys:** Collect detailed feedback about onboarding experience from recent hires
- **Mentor Approach Analysis:** Document and compare different mentoring approaches used across the team
- **Time to Competency Measurement:** Track how long different new hires take to reach similar productivity levels
- **Knowledge Acquisition Assessment:** Test what critical information new hires have learned during onboarding

## Examples

Two junior developers start on the same team within a week of each other. The first is mentored by a senior developer who provides a structured learning plan, daily check-ins, pair programming sessions, and comprehensive code reviews. The second is mentored by an equally skilled but overwhelmed senior developer who provides help only when asked and focuses primarily on immediate task completion rather than broader learning. After three months, the first junior developer is contributing independently and feeling confident, while the second is still struggling with basic concepts and considering whether they're suited for the role. Another example involves a team where new hires starting during busy periods receive minimal attention and learn primarily through documentation and trial-and-error, while those starting during quieter periods receive extensive one-on-one training and guidance, creating dramatically different career trajectories for people with similar initial capabilities.
