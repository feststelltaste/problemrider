## Description

Project resource constraints occur when projects cannot secure the human, financial, or organizational resources necessary for successful completion, despite having clear requirements and business justification. This can result from inadequate resource planning, competing organizational priorities, bureaucratic approval processes, or misalignment between project needs and available resources. Resource constraints often lead to project delays, scope reduction, or complete project failure.

## Indicators ⟡

- Projects consistently receive less budget or personnel than requested
- Resource requests require excessive approval time and bureaucratic processes
- Critical roles remain unfilled for extended periods despite active recruitment
- Teams are forced to work with inadequate tools, infrastructure, or support
- Multiple high-priority projects compete for the same limited specialized resources

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Delayed Project Timelines](delayed-project-timelines.md):** Projects fall behind schedule due to insufficient resources
- **Reduced Project Scope:** Features are cut to match available resources rather than business needs
- **[Overworked Teams](overworked-teams.md):** Available team members work excessive hours to compensate for understaffing
- **[Quality Compromises](quality-compromises.md):** Work quality suffers when teams operate with inadequate resources
- **Project Failure Risk:** Projects may fail completely due to insufficient resource investment

## Root Causes ▼

- **Poor Resource Planning:** Inadequate assessment of actual project resource requirements
- **[Competing Priorities](competing-priorities.md):** Multiple projects compete for limited organizational resources
- **Budget Limitations:** Organization lacks sufficient financial resources for all desired projects
- **Bureaucratic Approval Processes:** Complex approval chains delay resource allocation decisions
- **Unclear Project Value Proposition:** Projects don't clearly demonstrate ROI to justify resource investment

## Detection Methods ○

- **Resource Request Success Rate:** Track percentage of project resource requests that are approved
- **Resource Allocation Timeline Analysis:** Measure time between resource requests and actual allocation
- **Project Resource Utilization:** Compare planned versus actual resources allocated to projects
- **Cross-Project Resource Conflict Analysis:** Identify when multiple projects compete for same resources
- **Resource-Related Delay Tracking:** Correlate project delays with resource availability issues

## Examples

A digital transformation project requires three senior developers, a UX designer, and cloud infrastructure budget of $75,000. Despite executive endorsement and clear business benefits, the project sits in approval workflows for five months while the needed senior developers are assigned to other initiatives, the UX designer position remains open due to hiring constraints, and the infrastructure budget is rejected because it exceeds the quarterly cloud spending cap. The project team eventually receives one junior developer and is told to use existing on-premises servers, forcing them to either dramatically reduce scope or accept that implementation will take twice as long as originally planned. Another example involves multiple development teams that all need the same specialized database administrator to design their data architecture. Each team's project timeline depends on database expertise, but the organization has only one qualified DBA who becomes a bottleneck. Projects are forced to wait in queue for database consultation, creating cascading delays across multiple business-critical initiatives while development teams remain idle.
