## Description
Incomplete projects are a common problem in software development. They occur when features are started but never finished due to shifting priorities, a lack of clear requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. This can lead to a number of problems, including a great deal of wasted effort, a sense of frustration for the development team, and a loss of credibility for the organization. Incomplete projects are often a sign of a poorly managed project.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team has a large number of partially completed features.
- The team is constantly starting new features before they have finished the old ones.
- The team is not delivering any value to the users.
- The team is not happy with their work.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Increased Cost of Development](increased-cost-of-development.md):** A great deal of effort is wasted on features that are never finished.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The constant churn and lack of progress can have a negative impact on team morale.
- **[Negative Brand Perception](negative-brand-perception.md):** The organization loses credibility with the stakeholders.
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** The team is not working on features that would deliver value to the users.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** The team does not have a clear understanding of the project's goals and priorities.
- **[Constantly Shifting Deadlines](constantly-shifting-deadlines.md):** The project's end date is repeatedly pushed back.
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** The project's scope is constantly expanding.
- **Product Direction Chaos:** There is no single person who is responsible for managing the product backlog and protecting the team from shifting priorities.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Work in Progress (WIP):** Track the amount of work that is in progress at any given time.
- **Cycle Time:** Track the amount of time that it takes to complete a feature.
- **Throughput:** Track the number of features that are being completed over time.
- **Team Retrospectives:** Discuss the team's feelings about incomplete projects in your retrospectives.

## Examples
A team is working on a new mobile app. The team is constantly being asked to start new features before they have finished the old ones. As a result, the team has a large number of partially completed features. The team is not delivering any value to the users, and they are becoming increasingly frustrated. The project is eventually canceled.
