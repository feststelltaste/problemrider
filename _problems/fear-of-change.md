## Description

Fear of change is a psychological and practical barrier that prevents developers from modifying existing code. This fear stems from legitimate concerns about introducing bugs, breaking functionality, or causing system instability. When developers consistently avoid making necessary changes or improvements due to these concerns, it indicates deeper systemic issues with code quality, testing practices, and system architecture. This fear can become self-reinforcing, as avoided changes accumulate technical debt, making future modifications even riskier.

## Indicators ⟡
- Developers express reluctance or anxiety when asked to modify certain parts of the system
- Estimates for seemingly simple changes are inflated due to perceived risk
- The team frequently chooses workarounds rather than addressing root causes
- Discussions about code changes focus more on what might break than on the benefits of the change
- New features are implemented as additions rather than improvements to existing code

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Accumulation of Workarounds](accumulation-of-workarounds.md):** Instead of fixing core issues, developers create elaborate workarounds that add complexity
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Development slows down as teams spend excessive time on risk assessment and testing
- **[Stagnant Architecture](stagnant-architecture.md):** The system architecture doesn't evolve to meet changing needs because major refactoring is avoided
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Quick fixes are preferred over proper solutions, compounding future maintenance challenges
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team members experience anxiety and stress when working with certain parts of the codebase

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Brittle Codebase](brittle-codebase.md):** The existing code is fragile and prone to breaking with even small modifications
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** Without comprehensive test coverage, developers cannot verify that changes don't introduce regressions
- **[Past Negative Experiences](past-negative-experiences.md):** Previous attempts to modify the code resulted in significant problems or production issues
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Tightly coupled components make it difficult to predict the impact of changes
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Developers don't fully understand how the system works, making them cautious about modifications
- **[Deployment Risk](deployment-risk.md):** Poor deployment processes make it difficult to quickly rollback problematic changes

## Detection Methods ○
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about their confidence level when making changes to different parts of the system
- **Change Frequency Analysis:** Monitor how often different modules are modified; consistently avoided areas may indicate fear
- **Estimation Patterns:** Look for patterns where similar changes have wildly different estimates based on the code area involved
- **Code Review Comments:** Watch for excessive caution or lengthy discussions about potential risks during code reviews
- **Retrospective Feedback:** Listen for concerns about code stability and change difficulty during team retrospectives

## Examples

A team needs to update a business rule in their order processing system. The change itself is conceptually simple—adjusting a discount calculation—but the function handling discounts also manages inventory updates, sends email notifications, and logs analytics events. The developer assigned to make the change estimates two weeks instead of two hours because they're afraid that modifying the discount logic will inadvertently break the email system or cause inventory discrepancies. This fear is justified given the tight coupling, but it prevents the team from making necessary business changes efficiently. Eventually, they implement the discount change as a separate function with duplicated logic rather than fixing the original problematic function.
