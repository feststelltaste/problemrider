## Description
A perfectionist culture is one in which there is an excessive focus on quality and a reluctance to release anything that is not 100% perfect. This can lead to a number of problems, including analysis paralysis, long release cycles, and a lack of innovation. While a focus on quality is important, it is also important to be able to deliver value to users in a timely manner. A perfectionist culture can make it difficult to strike the right balance between quality and speed.

## Indicators ⟡
- The team is constantly debating minor details.
- The team is hesitant to release new features for fear of them not being perfect.
- There is a lot of rework and churn in the development process.
- The team is not learning from its mistakes.

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Delayed Value Delivery](delayed-value-delivery.md):** Users have to wait a long time to get new features because the team is not willing to release anything that is not perfect.
- **[Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md):** The team is not willing to take risks and experiment with new ideas for fear of failure.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The constant pressure to be perfect can be a major source of stress and frustration for the team.

The team is also not learning from its mistakes, and they are making the same mistakes over and over again.
