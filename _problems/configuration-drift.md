## Description

Configuration drift occurs when system configurations gradually change from their intended or documented state over time, leading to inconsistencies between environments, unexpected system behavior, and reduced reliability. This drift can happen through manual changes, automated processes that aren't properly controlled, or gradual accumulation of modifications that aren't tracked or standardized.

## Indicators ⟡

- Production systems behave differently than staging or development environments
- Configuration files differ across supposedly identical systems
- System behavior changes unexpectedly without corresponding code changes
- Manual configuration changes not documented or tracked
- Automated deployments fail due to environment-specific configurations

## Symptoms ▲



- **[Unpredictable System Behavior](unpredictable-system-behavior.md):** Identical applications behaving differently on different servers
- **Configuration Documentation Gaps:** Actual configurations don't match documented standards
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Difficult to reproduce issues due to configuration differences

## Root Causes ▼

- **Manual Configuration Changes:** Ad-hoc manual modifications not tracked or standardized
- **[Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md):** No centralized system for managing and tracking configurations
- **Environment-Specific Modifications:** Configurations customized for specific environments without proper documentation
- **Automated Process Drift:** Automation tools making gradual changes without oversight
- **Legacy Configuration Accumulation:** Old configuration settings persisting alongside new ones
- **Multiple Configuration Sources:** Configurations scattered across multiple files and systems

## Detection Methods ○

- **Configuration Monitoring:** Continuously monitor configuration files for changes
- **Environment Comparison:** Regularly compare configurations across different environments
- **Configuration Auditing:** Periodically audit actual configurations against documented standards
- **Drift Detection Tools:** Use tools that automatically detect configuration changes and drift
- **Baseline Configuration Management:** Maintain and compare against known good configuration baselines

## Examples

A web application runs perfectly in development but fails intermittently in production due to different database connection timeout settings that were manually adjusted months ago. The production database timeout was increased to handle long-running queries, but this change was never documented or applied to other environments. When developers try to reproduce production issues, they can't because their development environment has different timeout behavior. Another example involves a microservices deployment where individual service configurations have gradually diverged across different server instances. Some instances have debug logging enabled, others have different memory limits, and SSL certificate validation varies between servers. This configuration drift makes it impossible to predict system behavior and troubleshoot issues effectively.
