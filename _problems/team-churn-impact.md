## Description

Team churn impact refers to the negative effects on code quality, consistency, and system knowledge that result from frequent changes in team composition. As developers leave, they take valuable system knowledge with them, while new team members bring different coding styles, practices, and assumptions. Without strong processes to manage this transition, the codebase gradually becomes inconsistent, undocumented decisions are forgotten, and the overall system becomes harder to maintain.

## Indicators ⟡
- Significant differences in code style and approach between different parts of the system
- Critical system knowledge exists only in the minds of specific individuals
- New team members take longer than expected to become productive
- Code review discussions frequently involve debates about historical design decisions
- Documentation gaps in areas where key contributors have left

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** Different coding styles and patterns emerge as new developers contribute
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Understanding of design decisions, business rules, or technical limitations disappears when developers leave
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** Important information isn't written down and is lost during personnel changes
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** New team members need extensive time to understand systems and processes
- **Repeated Mistakes:** The team makes mistakes that were previously resolved but not documented

## Root Causes ▼
- **[High Turnover](high-turnover.md):** Frequent departures of developers due to market conditions, company culture, or career progression
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** No systematic process for departing employees to transfer knowledge
- **[Inadequate Onboarding](inadequate-onboarding.md):** New team members aren't effectively integrated into existing practices and standards
- **Lack of Documentation Culture:** Critical knowledge isn't captured in written form
- **[Undefined Code Style Guidelines](undefined-code-style-guidelines.md):** No established guidelines for maintaining consistency across different contributors
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Important decisions and context are shared verbally rather than documented

## Detection Methods ○
- **Turnover Rate Analysis:** Track the frequency of team member departures and their impact duration
- **Knowledge Audit:** Identify critical knowledge that exists only with specific individuals
- **Code Consistency Analysis:** Use tools to measure style and pattern consistency across the codebase
- **Onboarding Time Metrics:** Track how long new team members take to become productive
- **Documentation Coverage:** Assess what critical system knowledge is properly documented

## Examples

A payment processing system was originally built by a tight-knit team that communicated constantly and shared deep understanding of the business requirements. Over three years, all original team members left for various reasons, replaced by new developers who each brought different coding styles and frameworks they preferred. The new team discovers that critical fraud detection rules were never documented—they were implemented based on verbal agreements and institutional knowledge that left with the original developers. When a new regulation requires updates to the fraud detection logic, the current team spends weeks reverse-engineering the existing rules because no one understands why specific decisions were made. Additionally, the codebase now contains three different approaches to error handling, two different logging frameworks, and inconsistent database access patterns, making maintenance increasingly difficult. Another example involves a data analytics platform where the departure of the original architect led to six months of reduced productivity as the remaining team struggled to understand the complex data processing pipeline design without documentation or the ability to ask clarifying questions.
