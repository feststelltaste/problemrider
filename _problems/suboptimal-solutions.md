## Description

Suboptimal solutions occur when implemented systems or processes technically function but fall short of what could be achieved with better design, requirements analysis, or implementation approaches. These solutions may solve immediate problems but create inefficiencies, user frustration, or maintenance burdens that a more thoughtful approach could have avoided.

## Indicators ⟡

- Solutions work but require excessive steps or effort from users
- Workarounds are needed to accomplish common tasks
- Performance is adequate but much slower than necessary
- Solutions address symptoms rather than root causes
- Users express that "there must be a better way" to accomplish tasks

## Symptoms ▲

- **[User Frustration](user-frustration.md):** Users struggle with inefficient or poorly designed solutions
- **Reduced Productivity:** Solutions don't improve efficiency as much as expected
- **[Workaround Culture](workaround-culture.md):** Users develop informal workarounds for solution limitations
- **[Maintenance Overhead](maintenance-overhead.md):** Solutions require more maintenance than well-designed alternatives
- **Limited Scalability:** Solutions don't scale well as usage or requirements grow

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Pressure to deliver quickly prevents thorough solution design
- **[Quality Compromises](quality-compromises.md):** Quality standards lowered to meet constraints
- **Poor Requirements Analysis:** Insufficient understanding of actual needs
- **Design Skill Gaps:** Team lacks design expertise to create optimal solutions
- **Technology Constraints:** Technology limitations prevent optimal implementation

## Detection Methods ○

- **User Experience Assessment:** Evaluate how efficiently users can accomplish tasks with delivered solutions
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare solution performance against industry standards or alternatives
- **Usability Testing:** Test solutions with real users to identify inefficiencies
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Assess whether solutions provide expected value relative to alternatives
- **Scalability Testing:** Evaluate whether solutions can handle expected growth

## Examples

A document management system requires users to perform 12 clicks and navigate through 4 different screens to complete a task that should take 2 clicks, because the system was designed around the database structure rather than user workflow. While the system technically allows users to manage documents, it's so cumbersome that productivity actually decreases compared to the previous paper-based process. Another example involves a data integration solution that requires manual intervention every time new data sources are added, despite the requirement clearly stating that the system should handle new data sources automatically - the solution works but creates ongoing operational burden.
