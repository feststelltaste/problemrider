## Description

Reviewer anxiety occurs when team members feel uncertain, intimidated, or anxious about conducting code reviews, often due to lack of confidence in their abilities, fear of missing important issues, or concern about providing incorrect feedback. This anxiety leads to review avoidance, superficial reviews that focus only on obvious issues, or excessive time spent on reviews due to over-analysis and self-doubt.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members volunteer to write code but avoid reviewing others' code
- Junior developers rarely provide review feedback on senior developers' code  
- Reviews contain mostly safe, surface-level comments rather than substantial feedback
- Reviewers spend excessive time on simple changes due to uncertainty
- Team members express discomfort or stress about their reviewing responsibilities

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Review Bottlenecks](review-bottlenecks.md):** Only a few confident reviewers handle most reviews, creating delays
- **[Superficial Code Reviews](superficial-code-reviews.md):** Reviews focus on trivial issues while missing important design or logic problems
- **[Reduced Review Participation](reduced-review-participation.md):** Many team members avoid reviewing code, reducing review coverage
- **Delayed Feedback:** Anxious reviewers take much longer to provide feedback due to over-analysis
- **Lower Review Quality:** Anxiety prevents reviewers from providing thorough, valuable feedback

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Code Review Inefficiency](code-review-inefficiency.md):** No clear criteria for what constitutes a good review creates uncertainty
- **[Reviewer Inexperience](reviewer-inexperience.md):** Team members lack experience and confidence in reviewing code effectively
- **[Fear of Conflict](fear-of-conflict.md):** Concern about criticizing colleagues' work creates anxiety about providing feedback
- **Imposter Syndrome:** Reviewers doubt their own abilities and fear being wrong about issues they identify
- **[Blame Culture](blame-culture.md):** Environment where mistakes are criticized harshly makes reviewers afraid of missing issues

## Detection Methods ○

- **Review Participation Analysis:** Track which team members actively participate in code reviews
- **Review Quality Assessment:** Analyze the depth and value of feedback provided by different reviewers
- **Review Time Patterns:** Monitor unusually long review times that might indicate anxiety-driven over-analysis
- **Team Surveys:** Collect feedback about comfort levels and confidence in reviewing code
- **Review Feedback Quality:** Assess whether reviews catch important issues or focus only on surface problems

## Examples

A junior developer on the team has strong coding skills but consistently avoids reviewing senior developers' pull requests, claiming they're "not qualified" to review more experienced colleagues' work. When assigned reviews, they spend hours analyzing simple changes and provide only safe comments about code formatting rather than examining the logic or design. Their anxiety prevents them from contributing valuable perspectives that could actually improve the code. Another example involves a mid-level developer who takes 2-3 days to review changes that should take 30 minutes, constantly second-guessing their feedback and researching every comment before posting it. Their perfectionism and fear of being wrong creates significant delays in the development process, and they often end up providing overly cautious feedback that doesn't help improve code quality.
