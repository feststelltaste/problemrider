## Description

Missed deadlines occur when development teams consistently fail to deliver work within agreed-upon timeframes, whether those are sprint goals, release dates, or project milestones. This pattern indicates underlying problems with estimation, planning, execution, or external factors that prevent teams from meeting their commitments. Chronic deadline misses erode stakeholder confidence and can create a cycle of increased pressure and further delays.

## Indicators ⟡

- Sprint goals are consistently not met across multiple iterations
- Project delivery dates are regularly pushed back
- Team velocity is consistently lower than planned capacity
- Stakeholders express frustration about unpredictable delivery timelines
- Teams spend significant time explaining why work took longer than expected

## Symptoms ▲

- **Stakeholder Confidence Loss:** Business partners lose trust in the team's ability to deliver on commitments
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Missed deadlines create pressure for subsequent work, leading to more shortcuts
- **Planning Credibility Issues:** Future estimates and plans are questioned or ignored
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team feels constant pressure and sense of failure
- **Cascade Delays:** Missed deadlines in one area cause delays in dependent work streams

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Underlying productivity issues prevent timely completion
- **Poor Estimation Practices:** Consistent underestimation of effort required for tasks
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** Changing or unclear requirements disrupt planned work
- **Scope Creep:** Additional requirements are added without adjusting timelines
- **[Context Switching Overhead](context-switching-overhead.md):** Interruptions and task switching reduce productive time
- **External Dependencies:** Delays caused by dependencies on other teams or systems
- **Unrealistic Expectations:** Deadlines set without proper consideration of team capacity or complexity

## Detection Methods ○

- **Sprint Completion Rate Tracking:** Monitor percentage of sprint goals achieved over time
- **Delivery Date Variance Analysis:** Track actual vs. planned delivery dates for projects
- **Velocity Trend Analysis:** Compare planned vs. actual team velocity across sprints
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess business partner confidence in delivery timelines
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Systematically analyze reasons for specific deadline misses

## Examples

A mobile app development team consistently completes only 60% of their planned sprint work, causing feature releases to be delayed by 2-3 sprints on average. Investigation reveals that their estimates don't account for the complexity of testing across multiple device types and operating system versions, and they're frequently interrupted by production support issues that weren't factored into sprint planning. Another example involves a web development team that consistently misses project deadlines because their estimates assume ideal development conditions, but they spend 40% of their time dealing with infrastructure issues, unclear requirements, and dependency delays that weren't accounted for in project planning.
