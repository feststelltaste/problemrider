## Description

SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when applications fail to properly sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code that can manipulate database operations. These vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, data deletion, or complete database compromise, making them one of the most critical web application security risks.

## Indicators ⟡

- User input directly concatenated into SQL query strings
- Database queries constructed dynamically without parameterization
- Error messages revealing database structure or query details
- Applications using database accounts with excessive privileges
- Input validation missing or inadequate for SQL query contexts

## Symptoms ▲

- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers retrieving sensitive data from database tables
- **Data Manipulation:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of database records
- **Authentication Bypass:** SQL injection used to bypass login mechanisms
- **Database Schema Disclosure:** Attackers extracting database structure information
- **Command Execution:** Advanced SQL injection leading to operating system command execution

## Root Causes ▼

- **Dynamic Query Construction:** Building SQL queries through string concatenation with user input
- **Missing Parameterized Queries:** Not using prepared statements or parameterized queries
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** Insufficient validation and sanitization of user input
- **Excessive Database Privileges:** Database connections using accounts with unnecessary privileges
- **Error Information Disclosure:** Database error messages revealing query structure or data
- **Second-Order SQL Injection:** Stored user input later used unsafely in SQL queries

## Detection Methods ○

- **Input Validation Testing:** Test all input fields for SQL injection attack vectors
- **Automated Security Scanning:** Use security scanners to identify SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Code Review for Query Construction:** Review all database query construction code
- **Database Error Analysis:** Analyze error messages for information disclosure
- **Penetration Testing:** Perform manual testing for complex SQL injection scenarios

## Examples

A login form constructs SQL queries by directly inserting user input: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '` + username + `' AND password = '` + password + `'`. An attacker enters `admin'--` as the username, creating the query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = ''`. The `--` comments out the password check, allowing login as admin without knowing the password. Another example involves a product search that builds queries like `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%` + searchTerm + `%'`. An attacker inputs `'; DROP TABLE products; --` which terminates the original query and executes a destructive command, potentially deleting the entire products table. Using parameterized queries would prevent both attacks by treating user input as data rather than executable code.
