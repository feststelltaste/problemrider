## Description

Conflicting reviewer opinions occur when multiple team members reviewing the same code change provide contradictory or incompatible feedback and suggestions. This creates confusion for the author who must navigate between opposing viewpoints, often leading to multiple revision cycles as changes made to address one reviewer's concerns are criticized by another reviewer. The problem is particularly acute when reviewers have different philosophies about code design, testing, or implementation approaches.

## Indicators ⟡

- The same code change receives opposite recommendations from different reviewers
- Authors receive feedback that directly contradicts previous review comments
- Review discussions involve debates between reviewers rather than constructive feedback
- Multiple revision rounds result from conflicting suggestions rather than iterative improvement
- Authors express confusion about which feedback to prioritize

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Author Frustration](author-frustration.md):** Developers become frustrated trying to satisfy contradictory requirements
- **[Extended Review Cycles](extended-review-cycles.md):** Reviews take longer as authors try to address conflicting feedback
- **[Code Review Inefficiency](code-review-inefficiency.md):** Time is wasted on debates rather than productive code improvement
- **[Decision Paralysis](decision-paralysis.md):** Authors cannot make progress when faced with contradictory guidance
- **Reviewer Disagreements:** Review process becomes a forum for architectural or style debates

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Code Review Inefficiency](code-review-inefficiency.md):** No established criteria for resolving conflicting opinions
- **Undefined Architectural Standards:** Team lacks agreed-upon design principles
- **Different Experience Levels:** Reviewers with varying expertise provide conflicting advice
- **Competing Design Philosophies:** Team members have fundamentally different approaches to code design
- **No Review Hierarchy:** No clear process for resolving conflicts between reviewers

## Detection Methods ○

- **Conflict Detection Analysis:** Track instances where reviewers provide contradictory feedback
- **Review Resolution Time:** Measure how long it takes to resolve conflicts in review feedback
- **Author Revision Patterns:** Analyze whether code changes flip back and forth between different approaches
- **Reviewer Agreement Assessment:** Evaluate how often reviewers agree on significant design decisions
- **Team Survey on Review Conflicts:** Collect feedback on frequency and impact of conflicting review opinions

## Examples

A developer implements a caching mechanism and receives conflicting feedback from two senior reviewers. The first reviewer suggests using a third-party caching library for reliability and maintainability, while the second reviewer insists on a custom implementation to avoid external dependencies and maintain performance control. After implementing the library solution, the second reviewer blocks the review, leading to a lengthy discussion about architectural philosophy that delays the feature by two weeks. Another example involves a junior developer's first major feature where one reviewer recommends breaking down a large function into smaller methods, another suggests keeping it monolithic for performance reasons, and a third focuses entirely on error handling approaches that conflict with both previous suggestions. The junior developer spends days trying to satisfy all three reviewers and eventually escalates to a team lead to make the final decision.
