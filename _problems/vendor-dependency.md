## Description

Vendor dependency occurs when organizations become excessively reliant on external suppliers, technology vendors, or service providers for critical business functions. This creates significant risk when vendors change their terms, discontinue services, experience outages, or fail to meet performance expectations. High vendor dependency reduces organizational flexibility and can lead to disrupted operations when vendor relationships encounter problems.

## Indicators ⟡

- Critical business functions depend entirely on external vendors
- Switching vendors would require significant time and expense
- Vendor contracts heavily favor the supplier with limited flexibility
- Organization has little control over vendor roadmaps or priorities
- Vendor performance issues directly impact business operations

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Vendor Lock-In](vendor-lock-in.md):** High switching costs prevent changing vendors despite problems
- **[Single Points of Failure](single-points-of-failure.md):** Vendor outages directly cause business disruption
- **Limited Flexibility:** Vendor constraints limit organizational ability to adapt
- **Cost Escalation:** Vendor pricing increases without competitive alternatives
- **Feature Limitations:** Business capabilities constrained by vendor offerings

## Root Causes ▼

- **Convenience-Driven Decisions:** Choosing vendors for short-term convenience rather than long-term strategy
- **Build vs Buy Imbalance:** Over-reliance on external solutions without considering internal capabilities
- **Risk Assessment Failure:** Inadequate evaluation of vendor dependency risks
- **Cost Optimization Focus:** Prioritizing short-term cost savings over strategic independence
- **Technical Skill Gaps:** Relying on vendors due to internal capability gaps

## Detection Methods ○

- **Vendor Dependency Mapping:** Identify all critical business functions that depend on external vendors
- **Risk Assessment Matrix:** Evaluate impact of vendor failures on business operations
- **Contract Analysis:** Review vendor agreements for flexibility and exit provisions
- **Alternative Evaluation:** Assess availability and viability of alternative vendors or solutions
- **Business Continuity Testing:** Test organization's ability to function when vendors are unavailable

## Examples

A software company relies entirely on a third-party cloud service for their customer authentication system. When the vendor experiences a multi-day outage, all customer logins fail and the company cannot serve existing customers or acquire new ones. The company discovers they have no backup authentication system and migrating to an alternative would take months due to the proprietary APIs and data formats used by the current vendor. The outage costs significant revenue and damages customer relationships. Another example involves a manufacturing company that depends on a single ERP vendor for all business operations. When the vendor announces they're discontinuing the product version being used and forcing an expensive upgrade, the company faces a choice between paying substantial upgrade costs or undertaking a complex migration to a different system. The vendor dependency prevents the company from choosing the most cost-effective solution and forces them to accept unfavorable terms.
