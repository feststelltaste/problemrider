## Description

Quality compromises occur when teams or organizations deliberately accept lower quality standards, skip quality practices, or take shortcuts to meet immediate constraints such as deadlines, budgets, or resource limitations. While these compromises may provide short-term benefits, they typically create long-term problems including technical debt, increased maintenance costs, and reduced system reliability.

## Indicators ⟡

- Quality practices are skipped or reduced to meet deadlines
- Testing coverage is deliberately reduced to speed delivery
- Code reviews are rushed or bypassed for urgent changes
- Design and architecture decisions prioritize speed over maintainability
- Known quality issues are accepted rather than addressed

## Symptoms ▲

- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Accumulated shortcuts create increasing complexity and maintenance burden
- **[Quality Degradation](quality-degradation.md):** Overall system quality decreases over time
- **[High Maintenance Costs](high-maintenance-costs.md):** More resources needed to maintain compromised systems
- **[Customer Dissatisfaction](customer-dissatisfaction.md):** Users experience problems due to quality compromises
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team members become frustrated working with low-quality systems

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Pressure to deliver quickly leads to quality shortcuts
- **[Short-Term Focus](short-term-focus.md):** Management prioritizes immediate delivery over long-term quality
- **Budget Constraints:** Insufficient resources allocated to maintain quality standards
- **[Unrealistic Deadlines](unrealistic-deadlines.md):** Impossible timelines force quality compromises
- **Quality Devaluation:** Organization doesn't understand or value the importance of quality

## Detection Methods ○

- **Quality Metrics Tracking:** Monitor trends in code quality, test coverage, and defect rates
- **Process Compliance Monitoring:** Track how often quality processes are skipped or abbreviated
- **Technical Debt Assessment:** Measure accumulation of technical debt over time
- **Team Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess team satisfaction with quality standards and practices
- **Post-Release Quality Analysis:** Evaluate quality issues discovered after deployment

## Examples

A development team facing a critical deadline decides to skip unit testing for new features and reduces code review requirements to single-reviewer approval instead of the usual two reviewers. While this allows them to meet the deadline, the released software contains several bugs that require emergency hotfixes, and the codebase becomes more difficult to maintain due to untested code. Another example involves a project where architectural shortcuts are taken to quickly integrate with a third-party system, creating tight coupling and complex workarounds that make future changes extremely difficult and expensive.
