## Description
Constantly shifting deadlines are a common problem in software development. They occur when the project's end date is repeatedly pushed back to accommodate new feature requests, a lack of clear requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. This can lead to a number of problems, including a loss of credibility for the development team, a great deal of frustration for the stakeholders, and a decline in team morale. Constantly shifting deadlines are often a sign of a poorly managed project.

## Indicators ⟡
- The project's end date is constantly changing.
- The team is frequently missing deadlines.
- The team is constantly context-switching.
- There is a lot of rework.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Misaligned Deliverables](misaligned-deliverables.md):** The project is not delivering what the stakeholders expect, when they expect it.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The constant pressure to meet unrealistic deadlines can lead to stress and burnout.
- **[Loss of Credibility:]**(negative-brand-perception.md) The development team loses credibility with the stakeholders.
- **[Decline in Team Morale:]**(developer-frustration-and-burnout.md) The constant churn and lack of progress can have a negative impact on team morale.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** The project's scope is constantly expanding, which makes it impossible to meet the original deadlines.
- **Lack of Clear Requirements:** The project started without a well-defined scope or a clear understanding of what was in and out of scope.
- **[Unclear Goals and Priorities](unclear-goals-and-priorities.md):** The team does not have a clear understanding of the project's goals and priorities.
- **Product Direction Chaos:** There is no single person who is responsible for managing the product backlog and protecting the team from scope creep.
- **Poor Estimation:** The team is not good at estimating how long it will take to complete tasks.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Track Project Milestones:** Keep a log of all project milestones and see how often they are being missed.
- **Velocity Tracking:** In an agile team, a decrease in velocity can be a sign that the team is being burdened with unplanned work.
- **Compare Plan vs. Actuals:** Regularly compare the project's progress against the original plan to see how much the scope has changed.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** If stakeholders are constantly asking "Is it done yet?", it may be a sign that their expectations are not aligned with the project's reality.

## Examples
A team is building a new website. The project has a deadline of three months. However, the scope of the project is constantly expanding. The team is constantly being asked to add new features to the website. As a result, the team is not able to meet the original deadline. The deadline is pushed back a number of times, and the project is eventually delivered six months late. The stakeholders are not happy, and the development team is burned out.
