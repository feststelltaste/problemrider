## Description
Release instability is a state where software releases are consistently unreliable and prone to failure. This can manifest as a high rate of post-deployment bugs, performance issues, or other critical failures that require immediate intervention. Release instability is a major source of stress for development teams, and it can have a significant impact on user satisfaction and business continuity. It is often a symptom of underlying problems in the development process, such as inadequate testing, poor release management, and a lack of attention to quality.

## Indicators ⟡
- Every release is followed by a period of intense firefighting and bug fixing.
- The team is hesitant to release new features because they are afraid of breaking the system.
- There is a general lack of confidence in the release process.
- The business is reluctant to announce new features because they are not sure if they will work.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Frequent Hotfixes and Rollbacks](frequent-hotfixes-and-rollbacks.md):** The team is constantly deploying emergency fixes or rolling back releases to address critical issues.
- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** A large number of bugs are discovered in production after a release.
- **[Negative User Feedback](negative-user-feedback.md):** Users complain about the unreliability of the system and the constant disruptions to their workflow.
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** The constant pressure to fix broken releases can lead to stress and burnout.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** A lack of thorough testing is the most common cause of release instability.
- **Lack of a Staging Environment:** Without a realistic staging environment, it is impossible to test changes in a production-like setting before they are released.
- **[Change Management Chaos](change-management-chaos.md):** A poorly defined or ad-hoc release process can lead to mistakes and oversights that result in unstable releases.
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** When teams are under pressure to deliver features quickly, they may be tempted to cut corners on quality, which can lead to unstable releases.
- **[Monitoring Gaps](monitoring-gaps.md):** A lack of effective monitoring can make it difficult to detect problems in production before they impact users.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Release Failure Rate:** Track the percentage of releases that result in a critical failure.
- **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF):** Measure the average time between releases.
- **Change Failure Rate:** Track the percentage of changes that result in a failure.
- **Post-Release Bug Count:** Count the number of bugs that are reported in the days and weeks following a release.

## Examples
A software company releases a new version of its flagship product every month. However, every release is plagued by a series of critical bugs that require immediate attention. The development team is constantly working in a reactive mode, and they have little time for planned work. The company's customers are becoming increasingly frustrated with the unreliability of the product, and they are starting to look for alternatives.
