## Description

Session management issues occur when applications improperly handle user sessions, creating security vulnerabilities that allow attackers to hijack legitimate user sessions, perform session fixation attacks, or exploit weak session lifecycle management. Poor session management can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and compromise of user accounts.

## Indicators ⟡

- Users can be logged in from multiple locations simultaneously without restriction
- Session tokens remain valid after logout or password changes
- Session identifiers are predictable or insufficiently random
- Sessions don't expire appropriately or have excessive timeouts
- Session data stored insecurely or transmitted without encryption

## Symptoms ▲

- **Session Hijacking Vulnerabilities:** Attackers can steal and reuse legitimate session tokens
- **Session Fixation Attacks:** Attackers can force users to use predetermined session identifiers
- **Persistent Sessions:** Sessions remain active longer than intended or after logout
- **Concurrent Session Issues:** Multiple active sessions for single user creating security risks
- **Session Data Exposure:** Sensitive information stored in easily accessible session data

## Root Causes ▼

- **Weak Session Token Generation:** Using predictable or insufficiently random session identifiers
- **Improper Session Lifecycle Management:** Sessions not properly invalidated on logout or timeout
- **Insecure Session Storage:** Session data stored in client-side cookies or other insecure locations
- **Missing Session Security Attributes:** Cookies without Secure, HttpOnly, or SameSite attributes
- **Inadequate Session Validation:** Not properly validating session tokens on each request
- **Session Regeneration Issues:** Not regenerating session IDs after authentication or privilege changes

## Detection Methods ○

- **Session Security Testing:** Test session token strength, lifecycle, and security attributes
- **Session Hijacking Simulation:** Attempt to hijack sessions using various attack vectors
- **Session Storage Analysis:** Review how and where session data is stored and transmitted
- **Concurrent Session Testing:** Test behavior with multiple simultaneous sessions
- **Session Timeout and Invalidation Testing:** Verify proper session expiration and cleanup

## Examples

An online banking application generates session tokens using a simple incrementing counter, making session IDs predictable. An attacker can guess valid session tokens by trying sequential numbers and gain access to other users' banking sessions. The application also fails to invalidate sessions when users log out, allowing attackers with access to session tokens to continue using accounts even after legitimate users have logged off. Another example involves an e-commerce site that stores user authentication status in a client-side cookie without encryption or signing. Users can modify the cookie value to change their authentication status or impersonate other users. Additionally, the session cookies lack the Secure flag, allowing them to be transmitted over unencrypted connections where they can be intercepted by attackers.
