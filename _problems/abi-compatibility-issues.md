## Description

ABI (Application Binary Interface) compatibility issues arise when applications compiled against one version of a library or system component are used with a different version that has incompatible binary interfaces. This can cause crashes, memory corruption, incorrect behavior, or failure to load, as the application expects different function signatures, data layouts, or calling conventions than what the runtime library provides.

## Indicators ⟡

- Applications crash immediately upon startup or when calling specific library functions
- Functions return unexpected values or behave differently than expected
- Memory corruption or segmentation faults occur in library interaction code
- Dynamic linking fails with symbol resolution errors
- Applications work in development but fail in production with different library versions

## Symptoms ▲

- **Runtime Crashes:** Applications crash when calling functions with changed signatures
- **Symbol Resolution Failures:** Dynamic linker cannot find expected function symbols
- **Memory Corruption:** Data structure layout changes cause memory access violations
- **[Unpredictable System Behavior](unpredictable-system-behavior.md):** Applications behave inconsistently due to ABI mismatches
- **Function Call Failures:** Incorrect calling conventions cause function call failures

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Dependency Version Conflicts](dependency-version-conflicts.md):** Applications compiled against different library versions than runtime
- **Struct Layout Changes:** Changes in data structure member ordering or sizes between versions
- **Function Signature Modifications:** Changes to function parameters, return types, or calling conventions
- **Symbol Renaming:** Functions or variables renamed between library versions
- **Compiler Differences:** Different compilers or compiler versions producing incompatible binaries
- **Platform ABI Changes:** Operating system or hardware platform ABI modifications

## Detection Methods ○

- **Binary Analysis Tools:** Use tools to compare ABI compatibility between library versions
- **Symbol Verification:** Check that expected symbols exist and have correct signatures
- **Runtime Testing:** Test applications with different library versions to identify incompatibilities
- **Linking Analysis:** Analyze linking behavior and symbol resolution during application startup
- **Memory Layout Verification:** Verify data structure layouts match between compile and runtime versions
- **Compatibility Testing Suites:** Use automated testing to verify ABI compatibility across versions

## Examples

An application compiled against version 1.0 of a graphics library expects a Color struct with three integer fields (RGB), but version 2.0 changed the struct to four fields (RGBA). When the application runs with the new library, it corrupts memory by writing past the expected struct boundary, causing crashes and unpredictable behavior. Another example involves a networking library that changed a function signature from `send_data(char* data, int length)` to `send_data(const char* data, size_t length)` between versions. Applications compiled against the old version pass incorrect parameter types, leading to data corruption or crashes when the size parameter is interpreted incorrectly.
