## Description

Micromanagement culture occurs when organizational leadership requires detailed oversight and approval for decisions that could reasonably be made by individual contributors or teams. This culture prioritizes control and risk avoidance over productivity and employee empowerment, often stemming from distrust, previous negative experiences, or managers who believe they must personally oversee all aspects of work to ensure quality outcomes.

## Indicators ⟡

- Routine decisions require multiple levels of approval
- Managers want detailed reports on daily activities and progress
- Team members must get permission for standard professional activities
- Decision-making processes involve more oversight than the risk level warrants
- Employees express frustration about lack of decision-making authority

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Work Blocking](work-blocking.md):** Development tasks cannot proceed without pending approvals
- **[Approval Dependencies](approval-dependencies.md):** Team productivity is limited by the availability of approvers
- **Reduced Team Autonomy:** Team members cannot make decisions independently within their expertise
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Productivity suffers due to approval delays and context switching
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team members become demotivated by lack of trust and empowerment
- **[High Turnover](high-turnover.md):** Talented professionals leave to find environments with more autonomy

## Root Causes ▼

- **Risk Aversion:** Excessive fear of mistakes leads to over-control through approvals
- **Trust Issues:** Management doesn't trust team members to make appropriate decisions
- **Previous Bad Experiences:** Past incidents where delegated decisions led to problems, creating overcorrection
- **Manager Insecurity:** Managers who feel they must control everything to justify their role or demonstrate value
- **Organizational Liability Concerns:** Legal or compliance fears that drive excessive approval requirements
- **Traditional Hierarchical Culture:** Organizational culture that views authority and control as management's primary function

## Detection Methods ○

- **Decision Authority Audit:** Map what types of decisions require approval vs. those made independently
- **Approval Process Analysis:** Track the complexity and time requirements of approval workflows
- **Employee Satisfaction Surveys:** Measure team satisfaction with autonomy and decision-making authority
- **Manager Span of Control:** Analyze how many approval decisions managers handle and their impact on other work
- **Exit Interview Analysis:** Track whether departing employees cite autonomy issues as reasons for leaving
- **Process Efficiency Assessment:** Compare approval overhead costs with the risk of delegated decision-making

## Examples

A software development team requires manager approval for any library or tool addition, even for widely-used open-source packages. Developers waste hours writing justification documents and waiting for approval meetings to add standard development tools, while competitors ship features faster using the same tools. The approval process costs more in manager and developer time than the risk of choosing a suboptimal library. Another example involves a content team where writers need approval for social media posts, blog headlines, and even minor copy corrections. The approval bottleneck means timely content opportunities are missed, and writers spend more time managing approval workflows than creating content.
