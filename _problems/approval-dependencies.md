## Description

Approval dependencies occur when work cannot proceed without explicit approval from specific individuals, creating bottlenecks and delays in the development process. This problem is particularly acute when approvals are required for routine decisions, when approval authorities are frequently unavailable, or when approval processes are unnecessarily complex. These dependencies can bring entire teams to a standstill while waiting for authorization.

## Indicators ⟡

- Work frequently stops while waiting for approvals from specific people
- Approval requests accumulate faster than they can be processed
- Simple decisions require approval from senior management
- Team members spend significant time seeking approvals rather than doing productive work
- Approval processes vary inconsistently based on who is available

## Symptoms ▲

- **Work Blocking:** Development tasks cannot proceed without pending approvals
- **[Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md):** Specific approval authorities become constraints on team throughput
- **[Delayed Decision Making](delayed-decision-making.md):** Decisions are postponed waiting for approval authorities
- **[Micromanagement Culture](micromanagement-culture.md):** Team cannot make decisions independently within their expertise
- **[Context Switching Overhead](context-switching-overhead.md):** Team members switch tasks while waiting for approvals

## Root Causes ▼

- **Micromanagement Culture:** Management culture that requires approval for routine decisions
- **Risk Aversion:** Excessive fear of mistakes leads to over-control through approvals
- **Unclear Decision Authority:** No clear guidelines about what decisions can be made independently
- **Trust Issues:** Management doesn't trust team members to make appropriate decisions
- **Compliance Requirements:** Regulatory or organizational requirements mandate specific approval processes

## Detection Methods ○

- **Approval Queue Tracking:** Monitor how many approval requests are pending and for how long
- **Work Blocking Analysis:** Track how often work is blocked waiting for approvals
- **Approval Response Time:** Measure how long it takes to get approvals for different types of decisions
- **Decision Type Analysis:** Categorize what types of decisions require approval versus those that don't
- **Team Productivity Impact:** Assess how approval dependencies affect overall team productivity

## Examples

A development team must get approval from their director for any database schema changes, even minor ones like adding an index or renaming a column. The director is frequently in meetings or traveling, so schema change requests often wait 1-2 weeks for approval while development work is blocked. Simple performance optimizations that could be implemented in an hour instead take weeks to complete because of the approval bottleneck. Another example involves a team where any deployment to production requires approval from both the security team and the operations team, but there's no coordination between these approvals, so deployments often get approved by one team but delayed by the other, creating unpredictable deployment schedules and forcing developers to maintain multiple versions of their changes.
