## Description

REST API design issues occur when APIs violate REST architectural principles, use inconsistent conventions, or create poor developer experiences through unclear resource modeling, inappropriate HTTP method usage, or inconsistent response formats. Poor REST design makes APIs difficult to understand, integrate with, and maintain, leading to increased development time and integration errors.

## Indicators ⟡

- API endpoints don't follow consistent naming conventions
- HTTP methods used inappropriately for operations
- Response formats inconsistent across different endpoints
- Resource relationships poorly modeled or unclear
- API documentation doesn't match actual implementation

## Symptoms ▲

- **Inconsistent Resource Naming:** API endpoints use mixed naming conventions and patterns
- **Inappropriate HTTP Method Usage:** GET requests that modify data, POST requests for data retrieval
- **Poor Resource Modeling:** Resources don't map logically to business entities
- **Inconsistent Response Formats:** Different endpoints return data in different structures
- **Non-Idempotent Operations:** Operations that should be idempotent produce different results on repeated calls

## Root Causes ▼

- **Lack of REST Understanding:** Developers not familiar with REST architectural principles
- **Inconsistent Design Guidelines:** No established API design standards or guidelines
- **Legacy Integration Constraints:** Existing systems forcing non-RESTful design decisions
- **Business Logic Leakage:** Business operations exposed directly as API endpoints without proper abstraction
- **Rapid Development Pressure:** API design shortcuts taken to meet tight deadlines
- **Multiple Development Teams:** Different teams creating APIs without coordination

## Detection Methods ○

- **API Design Review:** Review API endpoints against REST principles and consistency guidelines
- **Developer Experience Testing:** Test API integration experience with real developers
- **API Documentation Analysis:** Compare documentation with actual API behavior
- **HTTP Method Audit:** Audit appropriate usage of HTTP methods across all endpoints
- **Response Format Consistency Check:** Verify consistent response structures and error handling

## Examples

An inventory management API uses mixed conventions where some endpoints follow REST patterns (`GET /products/{id}`) while others use RPC-style endpoints (`POST /getProductsByCategory`). The inconsistency confuses developers and leads to integration errors. Additionally, some endpoints return product data with different field names (`product_id` vs `productId` vs `id`) making client code complex and error-prone. Standardizing the API design to consistent REST conventions and response formats reduces integration time by 50%. Another example involves an e-commerce API where the checkout process requires multiple non-idempotent POST requests to the same endpoint, making it impossible to safely retry failed requests. Customers experience duplicate orders when network issues cause retry attempts. Redesigning the checkout API with proper resource modeling and idempotent operations resolves the duplicate order problem.
