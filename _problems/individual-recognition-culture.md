## Description
An individual recognition culture is a culture where individual accomplishments are valued more than team accomplishments. This is a common problem in companies that have a traditional, hierarchical management structure. An individual recognition culture can lead to a number of problems, including knowledge silos, poor communication, and team coordination issues.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members are not willing to help each other.
- There is a lack of trust on the team.
