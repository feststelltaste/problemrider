## Description

Circular dependency problems occur when components depend on each other in circular patterns, where component A depends on component B, which depends on component C, which depends back on component A. These circular references create issues with initialization order, testing, compilation, and make the system architecture more complex and fragile.

## Indicators ⟡

- Build systems report circular dependency errors
- Components cannot be initialized or loaded independently
- Unit testing requires complex setup to break circular references
- Dependency injection frameworks fail to resolve circular dependencies
- Module loading systems encounter circular reference errors

## Symptoms ▲

- **Initialization Order Issues:** Components cannot be properly initialized due to circular dependencies
- **Build and Compilation Failures:** Build systems unable to resolve circular references
- **Dependency Injection Failures:** DI containers unable to instantiate objects with circular dependencies
- **[Difficult to Test Code](difficult-to-test-code.md):** Cannot test components in isolation due to circular references
- **Module Loading Errors:** Import/require systems failing due to circular module dependencies

## Root Causes ▼

- **Mutual Component Dependencies:** Components needing direct references to each other
- **Shared State Management:** Components sharing state through direct references
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Missing interfaces or abstractions to break direct dependencies
- **Event Handling Coupling:** Components directly referencing each other for event handling
- **Utility Class Misuse:** Utility classes depending on components that depend on them
- **Lack of Dependency Inversion:** Not using dependency inversion to break circular references

## Detection Methods ○

- **Static Dependency Analysis:** Use tools to detect circular dependencies in codebase
- **Build Error Monitoring:** Monitor build processes for circular dependency errors
- **Dependency Graph Visualization:** Create visual representations of component dependencies
- **Initialization Flow Analysis:** Analyze component initialization order and dependencies
- **Module Import Analysis:** Review import/require statements for circular patterns

## Examples

A web application has a `UserService` that depends on `OrderService` to get user order history, while `OrderService` depends on `UserService` to validate user permissions. Both services are initialized at startup, but neither can be instantiated because each requires the other to be created first. The dependency injection container fails with a circular dependency error. The circular dependency makes it impossible to unit test either service independently because testing `UserService` requires `OrderService`, which requires `UserService` to be initialized. Another example involves a frontend application where `ComponentA` imports and uses `ComponentB`, while `ComponentB` imports utilities from `ComponentA`, creating a circular module dependency. The JavaScript module loader fails to resolve the circular import, causing the application to fail during the bundling process.
