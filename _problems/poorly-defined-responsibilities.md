## Description

Poorly defined responsibilities occur when software components lack clear, single purposes and instead handle multiple unrelated concerns. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and creates confusion about what each component does, making the system harder to understand, test, and maintain. When responsibilities are unclear or overlapping, developers struggle to know where to make changes, and modifications in one area can have unexpected effects on seemingly unrelated functionality.

## Indicators ⟡
- Developers struggle to explain what a class or module does in a single sentence
- Components handle multiple unrelated business concerns or technical responsibilities
- Changes to one feature require modifications to components that seem unrelated
- Similar functionality is implemented in multiple places because responsibility boundaries are unclear
- New features are difficult to implement because it's unclear where they belong

## Symptoms ▲
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Unclear responsibilities lead to components that depend on many others and have low internal cohesion
- **[Monolithic Functions and Classes](monolithic-functions-and-classes.md):** Components grow large as they accumulate multiple responsibilities
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** Mixing multiple concerns makes code harder to understand
- **Code Duplication:** Similar functionality is implemented multiple times because responsibility boundaries are unclear
- **Testing Difficulties:** Components with multiple responsibilities are harder to test comprehensively

## Root Causes ▼
- **Lack of Design Planning:** Components are created without clear definition of their intended purpose
- **Feature Creep:** Components accumulate additional responsibilities over time without proper refactoring
- **Convenience Modifications:** Developers add functionality to existing components because it's easier than creating new ones
- **Poor Understanding of SRP:** Team lacks understanding or application of the Single Responsibility Principle
- **Absence of Architectural Guidelines:** No clear principles for organizing code and defining component boundaries
- **Legacy Code Evolution:** Old components that have grown organically without conscious design

## Detection Methods ○
- **Responsibility Mapping:** Document what each component does and identify those with multiple unrelated responsibilities
- **Change Impact Analysis:** Track which components need modification for different types of changes
- **Coupling Metrics:** Measure how many other components each component interacts with
- **Code Review Focus:** Specifically examine component responsibilities during reviews
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members which components are hardest to understand or modify

## Examples

A `UserManager` class in a web application initially handled user authentication, but over time has accumulated responsibilities for user profile management, password reset email sending, user activity logging, permission checking, user avatar image processing, social media integration, and user analytics tracking. When developers need to add new user-related functionality, they're unsure whether it belongs in `UserManager` or should be a separate component. Adding a simple feature like user preference settings requires understanding and potentially modifying code related to email processing, image handling, and analytics. The class has become a catch-all for anything user-related, making it difficult to test, understand, and maintain. Another example involves a `DataProcessor` component that handles CSV file parsing, data validation, database storage, error reporting, email notifications, file archiving, and performance metrics collection. When the business wants to add support for Excel files, developers must understand all these unrelated responsibilities to determine how to safely add the new functionality. The poorly defined responsibilities make it unclear which parts of the component are core to data processing versus supporting concerns that could be separated.
