## Description

Deployment environment inconsistencies occur when applications are deployed across environments (development, staging, production) that have different configurations, dependencies, infrastructure, or settings. These differences can cause applications to work in one environment but fail or behave unexpectedly in another, making it difficult to ensure reliable deployments and consistent user experiences.

## Indicators ⟡

- Applications work in development but fail in production or staging
- Different performance characteristics across environments
- Environment-specific bugs that cannot be reproduced elsewhere
- Deployment processes that work inconsistently across environments
- Different feature behavior or availability across environments

## Symptoms ▲

- **Environment-Specific Failures:** Applications failing only in certain environments
- **Performance Variations:** Significant performance differences between environments
- **Feature Inconsistencies:** Features working differently or being unavailable in some environments
- **Data Format Differences:** Different data formats or schemas across environments
- **Integration Failures:** External service integrations working in some environments but not others

## Root Causes ▼

- **Infrastructure Differences:** Different hardware, operating systems, or network configurations
- **Configuration Variations:** Environment-specific configuration files or settings
- **Dependency Version Mismatches:** Different versions of libraries or runtime environments
- **Data Environment Differences:** Different database schemas, test data, or data volumes
- **External Service Variations:** Different external services or service configurations per environment
- **Manual Environment Setup:** Environments configured manually leading to inconsistencies

## Detection Methods ○

- **Environment Comparison Auditing:** Regularly compare configurations and setups across environments
- **Cross-Environment Testing:** Test applications in all target environments before deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code Validation:** Ensure infrastructure definitions are consistent across environments
- **Configuration Management Testing:** Verify configuration consistency and correctness
- **Automated Environment Provisioning:** Use automation to ensure consistent environment setup

## Examples

A web application works perfectly in the development environment but crashes in production due to different database connection pool settings. Development uses a small connection pool suitable for single-developer testing, but production has a larger pool that reveals a connection leak bug that wasn't apparent with smaller pools. The application also uses different logging levels between environments - development logs everything for debugging while production logs only errors, making it difficult to diagnose issues that only occur in production. Another example involves a microservices application where development environments use HTTP between services while production uses HTTPS. The application works in development but fails in production because SSL certificate validation isn't properly configured, and the development team didn't encounter this issue during testing.
