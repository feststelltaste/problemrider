## Description
Scaling inefficiencies occur when it is difficult or impossible to scale different parts of a system independently. This is a common problem in monolithic architectures, where all the components are tightly coupled and deployed as a single unit. Scaling inefficiencies can lead to high resource utilization, slow application performance, and a poor user experience.

## Indicators ⟡
- The entire system must be scaled up or down, even if only one part of the system is experiencing high load.
- It is not possible to scale different parts of the system independently.
- The system is not able to handle sudden spikes in traffic.
- The system is expensive to operate because it is not possible to scale it efficiently.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[High Resource Utilization on Client](high-resource-utilization-on-client.md):** The system is using more resources than it needs to, which can lead to high costs.
- **[Slow Application Performance](slow-application-performance.md):** The system is slow because it is not able to scale to meet demand.
- **[Poor User Experience (UX) Design](poor-user-experience-ux-design.md):** The user experience is poor because the system is slow and unresponsive.
- **[Unpredictable System Behavior](unpredictable-system-behavior.md):** The system is unpredictable because it is not able to handle sudden spikes in traffic.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md):** The system is designed as a monolith, with all the components tightly coupled.
- **[Shared Database](shared-database.md):** The components share a single database, which makes it difficult to scale them independently.
- **[Shared Dependencies](shared-dependencies.md):** The components share a common set of libraries and frameworks, which makes it difficult to update them independently.
- **[Load Balancing Problems](load-balancing-problems.md):** There is no load balancing strategy in place, so it is not possible to distribute traffic evenly across the system.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Performance Testing:** Use performance testing tools to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor the resource utilization of the system to identify which components are using the most resources.
- **Architectural Diagrams:** Create a diagram of the system architecture to identify which components can be scaled independently.

## Examples
A company has a large, monolithic e-commerce application. The application is composed of a number of different components, including a product catalog, a shopping cart, and a payment gateway. The product catalog is read-heavy, while the shopping cart and payment gateway are write-heavy. The company is not able to scale the product catalog independently of the shopping cart and payment gateway. As a result, the company has to overprovision the entire system to handle the peak load of the product catalog. This is expensive and inefficient.
