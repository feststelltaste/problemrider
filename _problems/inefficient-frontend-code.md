## Description
Inefficient frontend code can have a significant impact on the user experience. This can manifest as a slow-loading page, a sluggish user interface, or a high level of resource consumption on the client's machine. Common causes of inefficient frontend code include large, unoptimized assets, excessive DOM manipulation, and a lack of proper caching. A focus on frontend performance is essential for creating a fast and responsive user experience.

## Indicators ⟡
- The application is slow, even on a powerful device.
- The application is draining the battery on your mobile device.
- Your computer's fan is running at high speed when you use your application.
- You are getting complaints from users about slow performance.

## Symptoms ▲

- **[High Client-Side Resource Consumption](high-client-side-resource-consumption.md):** The user interface feels sluggish, with delays in animations, scrolling, or input processing.
- **Browser/App Freezes or Crashes:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, especially on less powerful devices.
- **High CPU Usage on Client:** The user's device CPU is consistently high when the application is in use.
- **Jank/Stuttering Animations:** Visual transitions and animations are not smooth.
- **Increased Battery Drain:** Mobile devices experience significantly reduced battery life.

## Root Causes ▼

- **Algorithmic Complexity in JavaScript:** Using inefficient algorithms or data structures in client-side scripts.
- **Excessive DOM Manipulation:** Frequent and direct manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM), especially in loops, which triggers expensive reflows and repaints.
- **Unoptimized CSS:** Complex or poorly written CSS that leads to expensive style recalculations and layout thrashing.
- **Large JavaScript Bundles:** Shipping too much JavaScript code to the client, increasing parse and execution times.
- **Blocking Operations:** Long-running JavaScript tasks that block the main thread, making the UI unresponsive.
- **Inefficient Event Handling:** Attaching too many event listeners or not properly delegating events.
- **Lack of Virtualization:** Rendering large lists or tables without techniques like windowing or virtualization.

## Detection Methods ○

- **Browser Developer Tools:** Use the Performance, Memory, and Network tabs in browser developer tools to profile CPU usage, memory consumption, and rendering performance.
- **Lighthouse/PageSpeed Insights:** Use these tools to get automated audits and suggestions for frontend performance.
- **Real User Monitoring (RUM):** RUM tools can collect client-side performance metrics from actual user sessions.
- **Code Review:** Look for common anti-patterns like direct DOM manipulation in loops, complex CSS selectors, or large JavaScript files.
- **Web Vitals:** Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) to understand user experience.

## Examples
A web application displays a large table with thousands of rows. Each time a user sorts or filters the table, the entire DOM is re-rendered, causing a noticeable freeze in the UI. Implementing a virtualized list or table component would significantly improve performance. In another case, a JavaScript function is responsible for updating a counter on the screen every second. Instead of directly updating the text content of a single DOM element, it re-creates the entire element and appends it to the DOM, leading to constant reflows and high CPU usage. With the increasing complexity of web applications and the demand for rich user experiences, efficient frontend code is paramount. This problem is common in applications that have grown organically without a strong focus on performance optimization or where developers lack deep knowledge of browser rendering pipelines.
