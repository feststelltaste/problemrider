## Description

Cache invalidation problems occur when cached data is not properly updated or removed when the underlying data changes, resulting in applications serving stale or incorrect information. This is a fundamental challenge in distributed systems and applications that use caching for performance optimization. Poor cache invalidation can lead to data inconsistency, incorrect business logic execution, and user-facing errors that are difficult to reproduce and debug.

## Indicators ⟡

- Users see outdated information that should have been updated
- Application behavior is inconsistent between different sessions or users
- Data appears to randomly revert to previous values
- Cache hit ratios are high but data accuracy is poor
- Manual cache clearing temporarily fixes data inconsistency issues

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Inconsistent Behavior](inconsistent-behavior.md):** Application shows different data to different users or at different times
- **[Cross-System Data Synchronization Problems](cross-system-data-synchronization-problems.md):** Cached data diverges from the authoritative data source
- **[Unpredictable System Behavior](unpredictable-system-behavior.md):** System behavior varies based on whether data is served from cache or source
- **[User Confusion](user-confusion.md):** Users see conflicting information or changes that don't persist
- **Business Logic Errors:** Decisions made on stale cached data lead to incorrect outcomes

## Root Causes ▼

- **Missing Cache Invalidation Logic:** Updates to underlying data don't trigger corresponding cache invalidation
- **[Race Conditions](race-conditions.md) in Cache Updates:** Multiple processes updating cache and data source create timing inconsistencies
- **Complex Cache Dependencies:** Cached data depends on multiple data sources that are updated independently
- **Time-Based Expiration Issues:** Cache TTL settings don't align with data change frequencies
- **Event-Driven Invalidation Failures:** Cache invalidation events are lost or not processed properly
- **Distributed Cache Consistency:** Different cache instances in a distributed system become inconsistent

## Detection Methods ○

- **Data Consistency Auditing:** Compare cached data with source data to identify discrepancies
- **Cache Hit/Miss Analysis:** Monitor cache statistics to identify unusual invalidation patterns
- **User Behavior Analysis:** Track user reports of inconsistent or stale data
- **Cache Invalidation Logging:** Log cache invalidation events to identify missed or failed invalidations
- **Automated Consistency Checks:** Implement periodic checks that verify cache-source data consistency
- **Integration Testing:** Test scenarios that involve data updates and cache invalidation

## Examples

An e-commerce application caches product inventory counts for performance. When inventory is updated through the admin interface, the cache is invalidated correctly. However, when inventory is automatically updated through the fulfillment system, the cache invalidation step is missing. Users continue to see outdated inventory levels and can place orders for items that are actually out of stock, leading to fulfillment failures and customer frustration. Another example involves a content management system that caches user permissions for authorization decisions. When an administrator revokes a user's access, the permission cache is not invalidated immediately. The user continues to have access to restricted content until the cache expires naturally several hours later, creating a security vulnerability.
