## Description

Duplicated research effort occurs when multiple team members independently investigate the same topics, technologies, or problem domains without sharing their findings or coordinating their research activities. This duplication wastes valuable development time and fails to build institutional knowledge that could benefit the entire team. The problem often stems from poor communication, lack of knowledge management systems, or unclear coordination of research responsibilities.

## Indicators ⟡

- Team members ask similar research questions at different times
- Multiple developers research the same technologies or approaches independently
- Repeated discussions about topics that have been previously investigated
- Similar documentation or proof-of-concept code created by different team members
- Research findings are not shared or accessible to other team members

## Symptoms ▲

- **Wasted Research Time:** Collective team time spent on research is much higher than necessary
- **[Extended Research Time](extended-research-time.md):** Individual research takes longer because previous work isn't leveraged
- **Inconsistent Technical Decisions:** Different team members reach different conclusions about the same topics
- **Knowledge Silos:** Important research findings remain isolated to individual team members
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Overall progress is slowed by inefficient knowledge building

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Team members don't communicate about their research activities
- **Lack of Knowledge Management:** No system for capturing and sharing research findings
- **Unclear Research Coordination:** No process for assigning or coordinating research responsibilities
- **Time Pressure:** Individuals start research immediately rather than checking if others have already investigated
- **[Team Silos](team-silos.md):** Different team members or subteams don't share information effectively
- **No Research Documentation:** Research findings aren't documented in a searchable, accessible format

## Detection Methods ○

- **Research Topic Tracking:** Monitor which topics team members are researching to identify overlaps
- **Question Pattern Analysis:** Track recurring questions that suggest repeated research
- **Documentation Review:** Look for multiple documents or code examples addressing the same topics
- **Time Tracking Analysis:** Compare research time against the complexity of topics being investigated
- **Team Surveys:** Ask about research coordination and knowledge sharing experiences

## Examples

Three different developers spend a week each researching how to integrate the application with a specific third-party API, each encountering the same authentication challenges and reaching similar conclusions about implementation approaches. None of them communicate their research activities or share their findings, resulting in three weeks of duplicated effort that could have been reduced to one week with proper coordination. Another example involves a team where multiple members independently research the same database performance optimization techniques over several months, each creating their own test setups and reaching similar conclusions about query optimization strategies, but never sharing their findings, causing each new performance issue to trigger the same research cycle.
