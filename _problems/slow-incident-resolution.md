## Description

Slow incident resolution occurs when system problems, outages, or critical issues take much longer to diagnose and fix than they should, extending the business impact and user frustration. This can result from poor diagnostic tools, inadequate operational procedures, knowledge gaps, or systems that are inherently difficult to troubleshoot. Slow resolution times compound the damage caused by incidents and reduce user confidence in system reliability.

## Indicators ⟡

- Mean time to resolution (MTTR) for incidents is consistently high
- Incidents require extensive investigation to identify root causes
- Team members struggle to locate and interpret diagnostic information
- Similar incidents take different amounts of time to resolve depending on who handles them
- Escalation procedures are frequently needed for basic problems

## Symptoms ▲

- **Extended System Downtime:** Outages last longer than necessary due to slow resolution
- **[User Frustration](user-frustration.md):** Users become increasingly frustrated with prolonged service interruptions
- **Business Impact Amplification:** Extended incidents cause greater business disruption
- **Support Team Stress:** Support and operations teams experience high stress during incidents
- **Reputation Damage:** Slow recovery times damage organization's reputation for reliability

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Poor Operational Concept](poor-operational-concept.md):** Inadequate planning for incident response and troubleshooting
- **[Monitoring Gaps](monitoring-gaps.md):** Insufficient visibility into system behavior during problems
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** System design makes problems hard to diagnose
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical troubleshooting knowledge concentrated in specific individuals
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** Troubleshooting procedures not documented or accessible

## Detection Methods ○

- **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) Tracking:** Monitor average time to resolve different types of incidents
- **Incident Response Time Analysis:** Measure time from incident detection to resolution
- **Escalation Frequency:** Track how often incidents require escalation to senior personnel
- **Diagnostic Efficiency Assessment:** Evaluate how quickly teams can identify root causes
- **Resolution Consistency Analysis:** Compare resolution times for similar incidents

## Examples

An e-commerce platform experiences database performance issues that cause slow page loads, but the operations team spends four hours trying to identify the problem because they have no database performance monitoring tools and must manually check various system components. The database issues could have been identified in minutes with proper monitoring, but the lack of diagnostic visibility extends the incident impact from what should have been a 15-minute fix to a four-hour outage. Another example involves a web application that crashes intermittently, but the error logs provide no useful information about the root cause. The development team must spend days reproducing the problem in development environments and adding additional logging before they can identify what's causing the crashes in production. Each crash affects users for hours while the team investigates, turning what should be a straightforward bug fix into a major reliability issue.
