## Description

Mentor burnout occurs when experienced developers become overwhelmed by the constant demands of training, guiding, and supporting newer team members, in addition to their regular development responsibilities. This problem typically arises when knowledge is concentrated in a few individuals who become bottlenecks for knowledge transfer, or when the organization fails to properly structure and distribute mentoring responsibilities across the team.

## Indicators ⟡

- Senior developers spend more time answering questions than writing code
- The same few individuals are constantly being approached for help and guidance
- Experienced team members express frustration about being interrupted frequently
- Mentors start avoiding or delaying responses to help requests
- Senior developers' own productivity and work quality begin to decline

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Single Points of Failure](single-points-of-failure.md):** Critical knowledge becomes dependent on increasingly overwhelmed individuals
- **[Reduced Individual Productivity](reduced-individual-productivity.md):** Mentors' personal productivity decreases due to constant interruptions
- **[Knowledge Sharing Breakdown](knowledge-sharing-breakdown.md):** Overwhelmed mentors become less effective at knowledge transfer
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Mentors experience stress and burnout from excessive responsibilities
- **[Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md):** Overall team output suffers as key contributors become less effective

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical knowledge is concentrated in too few individuals
- **[Information Fragmentation](information-fragmentation.md):** No systematic approach to capture and share knowledge
- **[Inadequate Mentoring Structure](inadequate-mentoring-structure.md):** No formal process for distributing mentoring responsibilities
- **[Rapid Team Growth](rapid-team-growth.md):** Too many new hires added simultaneously without adequate support structure
- **[Complex Domain Model](complex-domain-model.md):** System complexity requires extensive one-on-one knowledge transfer

## Detection Methods ○

- **Mentor Time Allocation:** Track how much time experienced developers spend on mentoring versus development work
- **Question Source Analysis:** Monitor who team members go to for help and how frequently
- **Mentor Satisfaction Surveys:** Assess mentor stress levels and satisfaction with their mentoring load
- **Productivity Impact Measurement:** Compare mentors' individual productivity before and after taking on mentoring responsibilities
- **Burnout Risk Assessment:** Use standard burnout assessment tools to evaluate mentor well-being

## Examples

A senior architect at a software company becomes the go-to person for all technical questions about the company's legacy system. As the team grows from 5 to 15 developers, she finds herself answering 20-30 questions per day, spending 60% of her time in mentoring conversations instead of working on critical architecture improvements. Her own work quality begins to suffer, she starts working longer hours to compensate, and she becomes increasingly frustrated with constant interruptions. The situation worsens when management assigns her two additional junior developers to mentor directly, pushing her mentoring responsibilities to over 80% of her time. Eventually, she begins avoiding team communication channels and considering leaving the company due to burnout. Another example involves a database expert who is the only person on the team who understands the complex data migration processes. As the company scales, he spends entire days walking different developers through database procedures, leaving no time for his own responsibilities like performance optimization and schema evolution planning.
