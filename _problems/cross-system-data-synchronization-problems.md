## Description

Cross-system data synchronization problems occur when organizations attempt to maintain data consistency between legacy systems and modern replacements during migration or modernization efforts. This challenge involves keeping multiple systems in sync while they operate simultaneously, often with different data models, update frequencies, and consistency requirements. Unlike simple integration challenges, these problems involve bidirectional data flow, conflict resolution, and maintaining referential integrity across system boundaries during transition periods.

## Indicators ⟡

- Modernization plans that require running legacy and new systems in parallel for extended periods
- Data models between legacy and modern systems that have significant structural differences
- Business processes that span both legacy and modern system components
- Requirements for real-time or near-real-time data consistency between systems
- Complex business rules that must be maintained consistently across multiple systems
- User workflows that involve data from both legacy and modern systems
- Integration points that require bidirectional data flow and conflict resolution

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Data Migration Integrity Issues](data-migration-integrity-issues.md):** Data inconsistencies between systems that require manual reconciliation
- **[Slow Application Performance](slow-application-performance.md):** Performance degradation due to complex synchronization overhead
- **[Data Protection Risk](data-protection-risk.md):** Data corruption or loss during synchronization failures
- **[User Confusion](user-confusion.md):** User confusion due to seeing different data in different systems
- **[Cascade Failures](cascade-failures.md):** Business process failures when systems are out of sync
- **[Operational Overhead](operational-overhead.md):** Increased operational overhead from monitoring and maintaining synchronization
- **[Deployment Risk](deployment-risk.md):** Rollback difficulties when synchronization issues affect multiple systems
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Escalating technical debt in data synchronization and transformation code
- **[Inconsistent Behavior](inconsistent-behavior.md):** Different behavior between legacy and modern systems due to sync delays
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Complex troubleshooting when data issues span multiple systems
- **[Increased Customer Support Load](increased-customer-support-load.md):** Support requests from users experiencing data inconsistencies
- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** Bugs introduced by synchronization complexity and edge cases
- **[Unpredictable System Behavior](unpredictable-system-behavior.md):** Non-deterministic system behavior due to synchronization timing
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team stress from managing complex synchronization scenarios

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Underestimation of data synchronization complexity during modernization planning
- **[Poor Domain Model](poor-domain-model.md):** Legacy and modern systems designed with incompatible data models and consistency assumptions
- **[Testing Environment Fragility](testing-environment-fragility.md):** Lack of robust synchronization infrastructure and conflict resolution mechanisms
- **[Unrealistic Deadlines](unrealistic-deadlines.md):** Business requirements for zero-downtime migration without proper architectural planning
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Time pressure that leads to shortcuts in synchronization design and testing
- **[Legacy Business Logic Extraction Difficulty](legacy-business-logic-extraction-difficulty.md):** Insufficient understanding of data dependencies and business rule interactions
- **[Network Latency](network-latency.md):** Network reliability and performance limitations affecting synchronization effectiveness
- **[Monitoring Gaps](monitoring-gaps.md):** Missing or adequate monitoring and alerting for synchronization failures
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Tightly coupled data models that resist synchronization
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** Complex business rules that are difficult to synchronize consistently
- **[Strangler Fig Pattern Failures](strangler-fig-pattern-failures.md):** Failed attempts to gradually replace legacy systems
- **[Database Schema Design Problems](database-schema-design-problems.md):** Schema mismatches that complicate synchronization
- **[Race Conditions](race-conditions.md):** Timing issues in concurrent data updates across systems
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Insufficient expertise in distributed systems and data consistency patterns
- **[Tool Limitations](tool-limitations.md):** Inadequate synchronization tools and technologies for the complexity required

## Detection Methods ○

- Implement comprehensive data consistency monitoring between systems
- Track synchronization failure rates and resolution times
- Monitor data reconciliation efforts and manual intervention frequency
- Assess user complaints and support tickets related to data inconsistencies
- Analyze performance impact of synchronization processes on both systems
- Review business process failure rates that correlate with synchronization issues
- Test synchronization recovery procedures and disaster scenarios
- Monitor technical debt accumulation in synchronization and integration code

## Examples

A healthcare organization modernizes their patient management system using a phased approach, running both legacy and new systems simultaneously for 18 months. Patient demographic updates in the new system must be synchronized to the legacy system for billing, while appointment scheduling in the legacy system must update the new system for care coordination. The synchronization process fails during network outages, creating scenarios where patients have different information in each system. When a patient updates their insurance information in the new system, but the synchronization fails, they receive incorrect bills generated by the legacy system. The team implements increasingly complex conflict resolution logic, but synchronization failures during peak usage create data inconsistencies that require daily manual reconciliation. Emergency department staff report seeing outdated patient information that compromises care decisions, while billing staff struggle with mismatched patient records that create insurance claim rejections. The synchronization complexity eventually becomes so problematic that the organization abandons the phased approach and performs a risky big-bang migration to eliminate the dual-system challenge.
