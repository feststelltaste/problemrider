## Description

Poor naming conventions occur when code elements such as variables, functions, classes, modules, and files are given names that fail to clearly communicate their purpose, behavior, or content. This includes names that are too short, too generic, misleading, inconsistent, or use unclear abbreviations. Poor naming forces developers to spend additional mental effort understanding code, increases the likelihood of mistakes, and makes maintenance more difficult.

## Indicators ⟡

- Variable and function names require additional comments to explain their purpose
- Code contains single-letter variables outside of loop counters
- Method names don't clearly indicate what they do or what they return
- Class names are too generic or don't represent clear concepts
- Team members frequently ask about the meaning of specific names during code reviews

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Difficult Code Comprehension](difficult-code-comprehension.md):** Developers struggle to understand code due to unclear naming
- **[Increased Cognitive Load](increased-cognitive-load.md):** Mental effort is wasted deciphering poorly named elements
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Poor names make it harder to trace program execution and identify issues
- **[Code Review Inefficiency](code-review-inefficiency.md):** Reviews take longer as reviewers need to understand unclear names
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** Misleading names lead to incorrect assumptions and bugs

## Root Causes ▼

- **Lack of Naming Standards:** No established conventions for naming different types of code elements
- **Time Pressure:** Developers choose quick, non-descriptive names to save time
- **Inconsistent Team Practices:** Different team members follow different naming approaches
- **Legacy Code Evolution:** Names become outdated as code functionality changes over time
- **Domain Knowledge Gaps:** Developers lack sufficient understanding of the business domain to choose meaningful names

## Detection Methods ○

- **Code Review Pattern Analysis:** Track how often naming issues are raised during code reviews
- **Naming Convention Compliance:** Use automated tools to check adherence to naming standards
- **Developer Surveys:** Ask team members about areas where naming makes code difficult to understand
- **Code Comprehension Testing:** Measure how quickly developers can understand code with different naming patterns
- **Name Length and Clarity Analysis:** Analyze the distribution of name lengths and use of abbreviations

## Examples

A payment processing system contains variables like `amt`, `flg`, `tmp`, and `data` throughout the codebase, making it nearly impossible to understand what values they represent without carefully reading surrounding code. A function named `process()` takes 15 parameters and performs validation, transformation, persistence, and notification tasks, but its generic name provides no hint about its complex behavior. In another system, a class called `Manager` handles user authentication, session management, and audit logging - three completely different responsibilities that aren't reflected in its name. The team also uses inconsistent naming patterns: some methods use camelCase while others use snake_case, some boolean variables start with "is" while others start with "has" or "can", and abbreviations are used inconsistently ("num" vs "number" vs "cnt" vs "count"). When a new developer joins the team, they spend the first month constantly asking colleagues to explain what different variables and functions actually do, significantly slowing their productivity and taking time away from other team members.
