## Description

An immature delivery strategy reflects the absence of well-defined, tested, and reliable processes for deploying software to production environments. This includes ad-hoc deployment procedures, inconsistent rollout approaches, inadequate testing in production-like environments, and poor coordination between development and operations teams. The result is unpredictable deployments that frequently cause outages, performance problems, or user confusion.

## Indicators ⟡

- Deployment procedures vary significantly between releases
- No standardized checklist or process documentation for deployments
- Deployments frequently require manual intervention or troubleshooting
- Different team members follow different procedures for similar deployments
- Production deployments often result in unexpected behavior or outages

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Frequent Hotfixes and Rollbacks](frequent-hotfixes-and-rollbacks.md):** Deployments frequently require immediate fixes or complete rollbacks
- **[Release Instability](release-instability.md):** New releases consistently introduce instability or performance issues
- **[User Confusion](user-confusion.md):** Users experience unexpected behavior changes without proper communication
- **Deployment Anxiety:** Team members are anxious and stressed about deployment activities
- **Extended Downtime:** Deployments take longer than expected and cause prolonged service interruptions

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Manual Deployment Processes](manual-deployment-processes.md):** Reliance on manual steps that are error-prone and inconsistent
- **Inadequate Testing Environment:** Testing environments don't accurately reflect production conditions
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Lack of coordination between development, operations, and business teams
- **[Deployment Coupling](deployment-coupling.md):** Multiple systems or components must be deployed together, increasing complexity
- **Insufficient Deployment Planning:** Little time spent planning and rehearsing deployment procedures

## Detection Methods ○

- **Deployment Success Rate Tracking:** Monitor percentage of deployments that complete without issues
- **Deployment Time Analysis:** Measure actual deployment time versus planned duration
- **Rollback Frequency Measurement:** Track how often deployments require rollbacks or hotfixes
- **Post-Deployment Incident Correlation:** Analyze incidents that occur shortly after deployments
- **Team Stress Level Assessment:** Survey team members about deployment-related stress and confidence

## Examples

A web application team deploys new features by manually copying files to production servers using FTP, then running a series of database update scripts through a GUI tool. Each deployment requires different files and scripts, and the process is documented in a text file that's often outdated. During a recent deployment, a developer forgot to run one of the database scripts, causing the application to crash for all users. The team spent four hours troubleshooting before discovering the missing script, and then had to coordinate with the database administrator to run it during business hours. Another example involves a microservices architecture where each service is deployed independently using different procedures - some through manual file copying, others through partially automated scripts, and a few through container orchestration. When deploying a feature that spans multiple services, the team must coordinate deployments across different systems and procedures, often resulting in version mismatches that cause API compatibility issues and service failures.
