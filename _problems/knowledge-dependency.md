## Description

Knowledge dependency occurs when team members, particularly those who are no longer new hires, continue to rely heavily on specific experienced individuals for information, decisions, and guidance that they should reasonably be able to handle independently. This creates a situation where team members cannot work autonomously and experienced developers become bottlenecks for routine tasks and decisions.

## Indicators ⟡

- Developers with months or years of tenure still ask basic questions about system functionality
- Team members wait for specific individuals to be available before proceeding with tasks
- Routine decisions are escalated to senior team members unnecessarily
- Work stops or slows significantly when key knowledge holders are unavailable
- Team members express lack of confidence in making decisions without consultation

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Single Points of Failure](single-points-of-failure.md):** Critical knowledge and decision-making capability is concentrated in specific individuals
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Work is frequently blocked waiting for knowledge holders to be available
- **[Micromanagement Culture](micromanagement-culture.md):** Team members cannot work independently on tasks within their competency level
- **[Mentor Burnout](mentor-burnout.md):** Experienced developers become overwhelmed with dependency from multiple team members
- **[Delayed Decision Making](delayed-decision-making.md):** Routine decisions are delayed waiting for specific individuals

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical knowledge remains concentrated in specific individuals rather than being shared
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** Information needed for independent work is not documented or accessible
- **Fear of Making Mistakes:** Team members prefer to ask rather than risk making incorrect decisions
- **Micromanagement Culture:** Culture discourages independent decision-making and experimentation
- **Complex Decision-Making Processes:** Unclear guidelines about what decisions can be made independently

## Detection Methods ○

- **Question Dependency Tracking:** Monitor how often team members ask questions that they should be able to answer independently
- **Decision Escalation Analysis:** Track what types of decisions are being escalated and whether escalation is appropriate
- **Work Blocking Frequency:** Measure how often work is blocked waiting for specific individuals
- **Independence Assessment:** Evaluate team members' ability to work autonomously on age-appropriate tasks
- **Knowledge Holder Availability Impact:** Assess how team productivity changes when key knowledge holders are unavailable

## Examples

A developer who has been with the team for eight months still asks the senior architect basic questions about database schema design, API endpoints, and business logic that should be well within their grasp by now. Despite having access to documentation and previous code examples, they consistently seek validation for routine decisions and implementation approaches. This dependency means the architect spends 2-3 hours daily answering questions that could be resolved through documentation or experimentation, while the dependent developer's work frequently stalls waiting for responses. Another example involves a team where mid-level developers cannot deploy code changes without having a senior developer review their deployment scripts and configuration changes, even for routine updates. This dependency creates deployment bottlenecks and prevents the team from implementing continuous deployment practices because too many team members lack the confidence and knowledge to handle deployments independently.
