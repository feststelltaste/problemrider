## Description

Copy-paste programming is a development practice where developers duplicate existing code instead of creating reusable, well-designed components or abstractions. While copying code might seem like a quick solution, it creates long-term maintenance problems, introduces inconsistencies, and makes the codebase fragile. This practice is often driven by time pressure, lack of understanding of existing code, or insufficient experience with proper abstraction techniques.

## Indicators ⟡
- Similar code blocks appear throughout the codebase with minor variations
- Git history shows frequent copying of large code sections between files
- Developers regularly ask "where else do I need to make this same change?"
- Bug fixes require hunting down multiple locations where similar code exists
- Code reviews frequently involve discussions about existing similar implementations

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Code Duplication](code-duplication.md):** Identical or nearly identical code exists in multiple locations
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Simple changes require updates in multiple places
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** Similar functionality works differently across the application
- **Copy-Paste Errors:** Subtle bugs introduced when copied code isn't properly adapted to its new context
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** Different variations of the same logic create inconsistent patterns

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Deadlines encourage quick solutions over proper design
- **Lack of Abstraction Skills:** Developers don't know how to identify and extract common patterns
- **Poor Code Discovery:** Existing reusable code is hard to find or poorly documented
- **Risk Aversion:** Fear that creating abstractions will take too long or introduce complexity
- **Review Process Breakdowns:** Review processes don't catch or discourage copy-paste patterns
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Developers don't understand the existing codebase well enough to identify reusable components

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Similarity Analysis:** Use tools like PMD's Copy-Paste Detector (CPD) to find duplicated code blocks
- **Version Control Analysis:** Examine commit history for patterns of copying files or large code sections
- **Static Analysis Tools:** Tools that can detect structural similarities between code segments
- **Code Review Checklists:** Include checks for similar existing functionality during reviews
- **Refactoring Opportunities:** Areas with high duplication are prime candidates for refactoring

## Examples

A web application has user authentication implemented in six different ways across different pages. When a developer needed to add login functionality to a new feature, instead of understanding and reusing the existing authentication components, they copied the login code from a similar page. However, they forgot to update the redirect URL after successful login, causing users to be sent to the wrong page. Additionally, the copied code contained a subtle bug that was later fixed in the original location but not in the copy, creating inconsistent security behavior. Another example involves an e-commerce system where product pricing calculations are copied and pasted across multiple modules. When the business introduces a new tax rule, developers must update the calculation in eight different places. They miss two locations, resulting in incorrect pricing on certain pages while others show the correct prices, confusing customers and causing revenue loss.
