## Description

Memory fragmentation occurs when the available memory space becomes divided into small, non-contiguous blocks due to repeated allocation and deallocation patterns. Even when sufficient total memory is available, applications may fail to allocate larger contiguous blocks, leading to allocation failures or forcing the use of slower, non-contiguous memory allocation strategies. This problem is particularly severe in long-running applications with dynamic memory allocation patterns.

## Indicators ⟡

- Memory allocation failures despite having sufficient total free memory
- Increasing allocation time for larger memory blocks
- Memory allocator reports high fragmentation levels
- Performance degradation in applications that require large contiguous allocations
- Heap compaction or garbage collection frequency increases significantly

## Symptoms ▲

- **Allocation Failures:** Applications fail to allocate memory blocks despite having sufficient total available memory
- **[Gradual Performance Degradation](gradual-performance-degradation.md):** Memory allocation becomes slower as fragmentation increases
- **Memory Allocator Stress:** Memory management system works harder to find suitable allocation blocks
- **Virtual Memory Pressure:** Increased paging activity as system struggles with fragmented memory layout
- **Application Instability:** Out-of-memory errors in applications that should have sufficient memory

## Root Causes ▼

- **Allocation Pattern Mismatches:** Frequent allocation and deallocation of objects with varying sizes
- **Long-Lived Small Objects:** Small objects with long lifetimes scattered throughout memory
- **Poor Memory Pool Design:** Memory pools with inappropriate block sizes for actual usage patterns
- **Missing Memory Compaction:** Garbage collectors or memory managers that don't compact fragmented memory
- **External Fragmentation:** Free memory blocks too small to satisfy allocation requests
- **Internal Fragmentation:** Allocated blocks are larger than requested, wasting space within blocks

## Detection Methods ○

- **Memory Profiling Tools:** Use heap analysis tools to visualize memory layout and fragmentation levels
- **Allocation Pattern Analysis:** Monitor allocation sizes and patterns to identify fragmentation causes
- **Memory Manager Statistics:** Track fragmentation metrics provided by memory management systems
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor allocation time increases that correlate with fragmentation
- **Virtual Memory Analysis:** Analyze page fault patterns and virtual memory usage
- **Heap Dump Analysis:** Examine heap snapshots to identify fragmentation patterns

## Examples

A server application allocates various-sized buffers for network operations throughout its runtime. Small buffers are frequently allocated and deallocated, while occasional large buffers for file transfers remain allocated for extended periods. Over time, the free memory becomes highly fragmented with small gaps between long-lived large buffers. When the application needs to allocate a 1MB buffer for a large file transfer, the allocation fails despite having 10MB of total free memory distributed across thousands of small fragments. Another example involves a real-time graphics application that allocates texture data and vertex buffers of different sizes. Poor allocation ordering causes large texture allocations to fragment the heap, making subsequent allocations for animation data fail even though sufficient memory exists in total.
