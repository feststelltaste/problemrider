## Description

Maintenance cost increase occurs when the resources required to keep software systems operational, fix bugs, and make modifications grow substantially over time. This increase often outpaces the addition of new functionality, meaning organizations spend more and more of their development budgets on maintaining existing systems rather than creating new value. The trend indicates accumulating technical debt and degrading system health.

## Indicators ⟡

- Increasing percentage of development budget spent on maintenance versus new features
- Bug fix time increases for similar types of issues
- Simple changes require more effort and testing than expected
- More developers needed to maintain the same functionality
- Support costs grow faster than user base or system usage

## Symptoms ▲

- **Budget Pressure:** Maintenance costs consume increasing portions of available budget
- **[Reduced Innovation](reduced-innovation.md):** Less budget available for new features and improvements
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team spends more time on maintenance than interesting new development
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** Reduced ability to invest in new capabilities
- **[System Stagnation](system-stagnation.md):** Systems can't evolve due to high maintenance overhead

## Root Causes ▼

- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Accumulated shortcuts increase complexity and maintenance burden
- **[Quality Degradation](quality-degradation.md):** Declining code quality makes maintenance more difficult
- **[Obsolete Technologies](obsolete-technologies.md):** Outdated technology stacks require specialized expertise
- **[Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md):** Architecture doesn't support efficient maintenance
- **[Information Decay](information-decay.md):** Poor documentation makes maintenance tasks more time-consuming

## Detection Methods ○

- **Cost Allocation Tracking:** Monitor percentage of development resources spent on maintenance versus new development
- **Maintenance Task Time Analysis:** Track how long similar maintenance tasks take over time
- **Defect Resolution Metrics:** Measure time and effort required to fix bugs of similar complexity
- **Total Cost of Ownership Assessment:** Calculate full lifecycle costs including maintenance
- **Resource Utilization Analysis:** Analyze how development team time is allocated between maintenance and new work

## Examples

A company discovers that 80% of their development budget is now spent on maintaining a 10-year-old e-commerce platform, leaving only 20% for new features and improvements. What used to be simple changes now require weeks of effort due to complex interdependencies and outdated technology. The maintenance team has grown from 2 to 8 developers just to keep the system running, while competitive pressure demands new capabilities that can't be delivered due to resource constraints. Another example involves a financial system where routine maintenance tasks that once took hours now take days due to accumulated technical debt, and the cost of maintaining the legacy system exceeds the cost of developing a modern replacement.
