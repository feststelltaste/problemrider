## Description

Delayed project timelines occur when software projects consistently take longer than originally planned, resulting in missed deadlines and extended delivery schedules. This pattern of delays can become chronic, where teams regularly deliver weeks or months later than promised, eroding stakeholder confidence and creating cascading effects on dependent projects and business initiatives.

## Indicators ⟡

- Projects consistently exceed their original time estimates by 50% or more
- Multiple project milestones are pushed back repeatedly
- Teams frequently request deadline extensions
- Project status reports show declining confidence in delivery dates
- Dependencies on other projects are impacted by delays

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Stakeholder Confidence Loss](stakeholder-confidence-loss.md):** Business stakeholders lose trust in the development team's ability to deliver on time
- **[Budget Overruns](budget-overruns.md):** Extended timelines lead to higher costs than originally budgeted
- **[Cascade Delays](cascade-delays.md):** Delays in one project cause delays in dependent projects or business initiatives
- **[Planning Credibility Issues](planning-credibility-issues.md):** Future project estimates are met with skepticism due to past delays
- **[Increased Stress and Burnout](increased-stress-and-burnout.md):** Pressure to catch up leads to overtime work and team fatigue

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Unrealistic Deadlines](unrealistic-deadlines.md):** Initial estimates are based on optimistic assumptions rather than realistic assessment
- **[Scope Creep](scope-creep.md):** Project requirements expand during development without adjusting timelines
- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Inadequate consideration of complexity, dependencies, and potential risks
- **Extended Onboarding Period:** New team members take longer than expected to become productive
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Legacy code and technical debt slow down development more than anticipated

## Detection Methods ○

- **Timeline Variance Analysis:** Track the difference between planned and actual delivery dates across projects
- **Milestone Completion Tracking:** Monitor how often project milestones are met on schedule
- **Velocity Trends:** Measure development team velocity over time to identify declining productivity patterns
- **Risk Materialization Rate:** Assess how frequently identified risks actually impact project timelines
- **Estimation Accuracy Metrics:** Compare initial estimates with actual effort for completed features

## Examples

A mobile app development team estimates a new feature will take 6 weeks to complete, but after 8 weeks they're only 60% done. The delay is caused by unexpected complexity in integrating with third-party APIs, technical debt in the authentication system that required refactoring, and a key developer being pulled onto emergency bug fixes. The marketing team has already announced the feature launch date, and the customer support team has been trained on functionality that isn't ready. Another example involves a data migration project originally scoped for 3 months that stretches to 8 months due to discovery of data quality issues, unexpected dependencies on legacy systems, and the need to build additional validation tools that weren't initially planned. The delay impacts the planned decommissioning of the old system and forces the company to maintain parallel systems longer than budgeted.
