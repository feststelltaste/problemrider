## Description

Capacity mismatch occurs when the available capacity at different stages of the development process is not aligned with actual demand patterns. This can manifest as some process stages being overwhelmed while others have excess capacity, creating an inefficient flow where resources are wasted while bottlenecks form elsewhere. Effective capacity matching requires understanding demand patterns and allocating resources accordingly.

## Indicators ⟡

- Some team members or process stages are consistently overloaded while others have spare capacity
- Work queues build up at certain stages while other stages remain idle
- Process throughput is limited by capacity constraints at specific stages
- Resource utilization varies dramatically across different roles or process steps
- Adding resources to the team doesn't improve overall throughput

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md):** Specific stages become constraints on overall process flow
- **[Uneven Workload Distribution](uneven-workload-distribution.md):** Some team members are overloaded while others are underutilized
- **[Resource Waste](resource-waste.md):** Available capacity goes unused while other areas are constrained
- **[Work Queue Buildup](work-queue-buildup.md):** Tasks accumulate at capacity-constrained stages
- **Reduced Overall Throughput:** Total system output is limited by capacity mismatches

## Root Causes ▼

- **Inadequate Capacity Planning:** No systematic analysis of capacity needs across process stages
- **Historical Capacity Allocation:** Resource allocation based on past patterns rather than current demand
- **Skill Specialization:** Team members with specialized skills create capacity constraints
- **Process Changes:** Changes to process flow alter capacity requirements without corresponding resource adjustments
- **Variable Demand Patterns:** Demand varies in ways that don't match current capacity allocation

## Detection Methods ○

- **Capacity Utilization Analysis:** Monitor utilization rates across different roles and process stages
- **Throughput Analysis:** Measure actual throughput versus theoretical capacity at each stage
- **Queue Length Monitoring:** Track where work accumulates and where capacity sits idle
- **Resource Allocation Review:** Assess whether resource distribution matches actual demand patterns
- **Flow Efficiency Measurement:** Calculate overall process efficiency considering capacity constraints

## Examples

A software development team has five developers but only one person qualified to do database work. The team consistently has database-related tasks backing up in a queue while other developers wait for database changes to be completed before they can proceed with their work. Despite having adequate overall development capacity, the team's throughput is limited by the single database specialist. Another example involves a testing team where automated test creation capacity far exceeds manual testing capacity, but the process requires manual verification of all automated test results. The automated testing team becomes idle waiting for manual testers to catch up, while the manual testing team is overwhelmed with verification work.
