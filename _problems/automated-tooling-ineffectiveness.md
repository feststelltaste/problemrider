## Description
Automated tooling ineffectiveness is a situation where automated tooling, such as linters and formatters, is not effective because of the inconsistency of the codebase. This is a common problem in teams that do not have a clear set of coding standards. Automated tooling ineffectiveness can lead to a number of problems, including a decrease in code quality, an increase in the number of bugs, and a general slowdown in the development process.

## Indicators ⟡
- The automated tooling is constantly reporting a large number of violations.
- Developers are ignoring the violations reported by the automated tooling.
- The automated tooling is not able to fix all the violations automatically.
- The automated tooling is not being used consistently by all developers.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** The codebase is inconsistent, which makes it difficult for the automated tooling to be effective.
- **[Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md):** The code quality suffers because the automated tooling is not able to enforce a consistent style.
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** The number of bugs is increasing because the automated tooling is not able to catch common errors.
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** It takes a long time to get code reviewed and merged because of all the style issues.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Undefined Code Style Guidelines](undefined-code-style-guidelines.md):** The team has not agreed on a common set of coding standards and conventions.
- **Lack of Automated Enforcement (of style):** There are no tools (like linters or formatters) in place to automatically enforce the agreed-upon style.
- **[Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md):** The code review process does not consistently enforce coding standards.
- **[Team Churn Impact](team-churn-impact.md):** Different developers bring their own personal coding styles without alignment.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Analyze the output of the automated tooling:** Look for a large number of violations.
- **Team Surveys:** Ask developers if they are using the automated tooling consistently.
- **Retrospectives:** Use retrospectives to identify problems with the automated tooling.

## Examples
A team has a linter configured for their project. However, the linter is constantly reporting a large number of violations. The developers are ignoring the violations because there are so many of them. As a result, the linter is not effective, and the codebase is inconsistent. This leads to a number of problems, including a decrease in code quality and an increase in the number of bugs.
