## Description

Synchronization problems occur when similar or identical functionality exists in multiple places within a codebase, and changes made to one instance fail to be propagated to the others. This creates a system where supposedly equivalent components behave differently, leading to unpredictable user experiences, inconsistent business logic, and maintenance nightmares. The problem is particularly insidious because it often emerges gradually as different copies of the logic evolve independently over time.

## Indicators ⟡
- Bug fixes applied in one location don't resolve the issue in other parts of the system
- Feature updates work correctly in some workflows but not others
- Different parts of the system produce different results for the same input
- Code reviews reveal multiple implementations of the same business logic
- Developers ask "where else do I need to make this change?" when fixing issues

## Symptoms ▲
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** The same business process produces different outcomes depending on where it's triggered
- **[Code Duplication](code-duplication.md):** Multiple copies of similar logic exist throughout the codebase
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** Different implementations lead to varying approaches and standards
- **Partial Bug Fixes:** Issues appear resolved but resurface in different contexts
- **User Confusion:** End users encounter different behavior for what should be identical operations
- **Testing Complexity:** Quality assurance must verify the same functionality in multiple locations

## Root Causes ▼
- **Communication Breakdown:** Development teams don't coordinate when making changes to duplicated code
- **Incomplete Knowledge:** Developers are unaware of all locations where similar logic exists
- **Time Pressure:** Quick fixes are applied locally without considering system-wide implications
- **Lack of Documentation:** No central registry or documentation of duplicated functionality
- **Review Process Breakdowns:** Review processes don't catch when changes should be applied elsewhere
- **Copy-Paste Development:** Features are implemented by copying existing code rather than creating shared components

## Detection Methods ○
- **Differential Analysis:** Compare behavior of supposedly identical features across different system areas
- **Bug Pattern Analysis:** Track bugs that appear to be fixed but reoccur in different locations
- **Code Similarity Tools:** Use static analysis to identify duplicate or similar code blocks
- **Integration Testing:** Run end-to-end tests that exercise the same logic through different pathways
- **User Feedback Analysis:** Monitor support tickets for reports of inconsistent system behavior

## Examples

An e-commerce platform has customer address validation logic duplicated in three places: user registration, checkout, and profile management. When a security vulnerability is discovered in the email validation component, developers fix it in the registration module but miss the other two locations. This results in inconsistent validation where users can create accounts with invalid email addresses through the profile update feature, even though registration properly rejects them. Another example involves a reporting system where currency formatting code exists in twelve different modules. When business requirements change to display currency with three decimal places instead of two, developers update eight of the modules but miss four others, resulting in financial reports that display the same monetary values with different precision levels, confusing stakeholders and potentially causing compliance issues.
