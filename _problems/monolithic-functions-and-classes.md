## Description

Monolithic functions and classes are code components that have grown to handle multiple, often unrelated responsibilities within a single unit. These "god functions" or "god classes" violate the Single Responsibility Principle and become central points of complexity that are difficult to understand, modify, test, or reuse. They often emerge organically as features are added over time, with developers continuously extending existing functions rather than creating new, focused components.

## Indicators ⟡
- Functions that are hundreds or thousands of lines long
- Classes with dozens of methods and instance variables
- Functions or methods that require extensive scrolling to review completely
- Code that handles multiple distinct business concepts or technical concerns
- Difficulty summarizing what a function or class does in a single sentence

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** The sheer size and scope make the code difficult to understand
- **[Difficult to Test Code](difficult-to-test-code.md):** Testing individual aspects requires setting up the entire complex component
- **[Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md):** Monolithic design creates constraints that limit maintainability and development velocity
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Multiple responsibilities create dependencies on many different system parts
- **[Code Duplication](code-duplication.md):** Developers copy and paste code rather than refactor large, complex functions.
- **[Merge Conflicts](merge-conflicts.md):** Multiple developers frequently modify the same large functions, creating version control conflicts
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Finding and fixing bugs becomes challenging due to the complexity and scope

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Feature Creep](feature-creep.md):** Existing functions are extended with new features rather than creating new focused components
- **Lack of Refactoring:** No effort to break down large components as they grow over time
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Quick fixes and additions are made to existing code rather than proper restructuring
- **Insufficient Design Skills:** Developers lack experience in identifying and creating appropriate abstractions
- **[Fear of Breaking Changes](fear-of-breaking-changes.md):** Reluctance to modify working code leads to continuous additions rather than restructuring
- **Legacy Code Evolution:** Long-lived code accumulates responsibilities over many years of modifications

## Detection Methods ○
- **Code Metrics Tools:** Use static analysis tools to measure function length, cyclomatic complexity, and class size
- **Responsibility Analysis:** Identify functions or classes that handle multiple distinct business or technical concerns
- **Code Review Patterns:** Look for reviews that mention difficulty understanding or testing specific components
- **Change Frequency Analysis:** Components that are modified frequently may be handling too many responsibilities
- **Testing Complexity:** Identify components that require extensive setup or multiple test scenarios

## Examples

An e-commerce application has a single `processOrder` function that handles payment processing, inventory updates, customer notifications, order logging, tax calculations, shipping arrangements, loyalty point updates, and fraud detection. This 800-line function is modified whenever any aspect of order processing changes, making it a constant source of bugs and merge conflicts. Testing this function requires mocking payment systems, databases, email services, and multiple external APIs. When a simple change is needed to the tax calculation logic, developers must understand the entire order processing workflow and risk breaking payment processing or inventory management. Another example involves a `UserManager` class with 45 methods that handles user authentication, profile management, permissions, password reset, email verification, activity logging, and social media integration. Any change to user functionality requires understanding this massive class, and testing individual features like password reset requires initializing the entire user management system.
