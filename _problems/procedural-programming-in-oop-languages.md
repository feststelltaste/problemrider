## Description

Procedural programming in OOP languages occurs when developers write code using procedural paradigms within object-oriented programming languages, failing to leverage the benefits of object-oriented design principles. This results in code that resembles procedural programs with long sequences of statements, minimal use of classes and objects, and poor encapsulation. While procedural programming has its place, using it inappropriately in object-oriented contexts leads to code that's difficult to maintain, test, and extend.

## Indicators ⟡
- Classes contain primarily static methods with little or no instance state
- Long methods that perform multiple sequential operations without meaningful object interactions
- Data and behavior are separated, with data structures passed between utility methods
- Minimal use of inheritance, polymorphism, or other object-oriented features
- Code resembles a series of utility functions rather than interacting objects

## Symptoms ▲
- **[High Coupling and Low Cohesion](high-coupling-low-cohesion.md):** Procedural code often creates tight coupling between functions and low cohesion within modules
- **[Monolithic Functions and Classes](monolithic-functions-and-classes.md):** Functions become large and handle multiple responsibilities
- **[Complex and Obscure Logic](complex-and-obscure-logic.md):** Long procedural sequences can become difficult to understand and maintain
- **Poor Encapsulation:** Data and behavior are not properly encapsulated within objects
- **Difficult Code Reuse:** Procedural code is harder to reuse in different contexts compared to well-designed objects

## Root Causes ▼
- **Procedural Background:** Developers come from procedural programming backgrounds and haven't adapted to object-oriented thinking
- **Lack of OOP Training:** Insufficient understanding of object-oriented design principles and patterns
- **Time Pressure:** Quick implementations using familiar procedural approaches rather than proper object-oriented design
- **Legacy Code Influence:** Existing procedural code influences new development to follow the same patterns
- **Misunderstanding of OOP:** Treating classes as mere namespaces for grouping related functions rather than as object templates
- **Over-reliance on Utility Classes:** Creating classes that contain only static methods instead of meaningful objects

## Detection Methods ○
- **Static Method Analysis:** Identify classes with high percentages of static methods relative to instance methods
- **Class Cohesion Metrics:** Measure how well methods and data within classes work together
- **Method Length Analysis:** Look for unusually long methods that perform sequential operations
- **Object Interaction Analysis:** Examine whether objects interact meaningfully or just serve as data containers
- **Design Pattern Usage:** Assess whether code leverages object-oriented design patterns appropriately

## Examples

A Java application for processing customer orders contains a `CustomerOrderProcessor` class with a single static method `processOrder(OrderData orderData)` that is 800 lines long. The method performs validation, inventory checking, payment processing, shipping calculation, email sending, and database updates in a sequential, procedural manner. Instead of creating meaningful objects like `Order`, `PaymentProcessor`, `InventoryManager`, and `ShippingCalculator` that encapsulate behavior and state, all logic is contained in procedural functions that pass data structures between each other. When new order types are added, the entire function must be modified, violating the open-closed principle and making the code increasingly complex. Another example involves a C# content management system where all functionality is implemented in static utility classes like `ContentUtils`, `UserUtils`, and `DatabaseUtils`. These classes contain dozens of static methods that manipulate data transfer objects, but there are no meaningful domain objects that encapsulate business behavior. Adding new content types requires modifications across multiple utility classes, and the lack of polymorphism means extensive if-else statements are used to handle different content types throughout the codebase.
