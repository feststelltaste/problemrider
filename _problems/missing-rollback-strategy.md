## Description

Deployment Risk occurs when teams deploy systems without having a reliable, tested method to quickly revert to a previous working state when problems arise. This creates significant risk during deployments, as any issues discovered post-deployment can only be resolved by fixing forward, which may take considerable time and cause extended outages. The absence of rollback capabilities often leads to deployment anxiety, longer incident resolution times, and greater impact when deployments go wrong.

## Indicators ⟡

- Deployment procedures that only document forward deployment steps
- Database migration scripts without corresponding rollback scripts
- Infrastructure changes that are difficult or impossible to reverse
- Deployment anxiety and reluctance to deploy during business hours
- Incident response plans that assume fixing forward as the only option
- No testing of rollback procedures during deployment planning
- Configuration changes that overwrite previous settings without backup

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Cascade Failures](cascade-failures.md):** Extended outages when deployments cause critical issues
- **[Constant Firefighting](constant-firefighting.md):** Pressure to fix problems in production rather than reverting to safety
- **[Release Anxiety](release-anxiety.md):** High stress levels during deployment activities
- **[Frequent Hotfixes and Rollbacks](frequent-hotfixes-and-rollbacks.md):** Incidents that require emergency hotfixes instead of clean rollbacks
- **[User Trust Erosion](user-trust-erosion.md):** Customer impact that extends longer than necessary during deployment issues
- **[Manual Deployment Processes](manual-deployment-processes.md):** Manual, error-prone processes when attempting to undo changes
- **[Fear of Change](fear-of-change.md):** Reluctance to deploy frequently due to rollback concerns
- **[Single Points of Failure](single-points-of-failure.md):** Post-incident reviews that identify rollback capability as a key gap
- **[High Defect Rate in Production](high-defect-rate-in-production.md):** Production issues that cannot be quickly resolved through rollback
- **[Release Instability](release-instability.md):** Unreliable releases due to lack of rollback safety net
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team stress from high-risk deployment scenarios
- **[Operational Overhead](operational-overhead.md):** Excessive manual effort required to recover from deployment failures
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Complex troubleshooting when quick rollback is not available
- **[Stakeholder Confidence Loss](stakeholder-confidence-loss.md):** Business stakeholder concern about deployment reliability

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Deployment processes designed without considering failure scenarios
- **[Database Schema Design Problems](database-schema-design-problems.md):** Database schema changes that are inherently difficult to reverse
- **[Inadequate Configuration Management](inadequate-configuration-management.md):** Infrastructure as code that doesn't maintain previous state information
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Time pressure during deployment planning that skips rollback considerations
- **[Knowledge Gaps](knowledge-gaps.md):** Lack of experience with deployment failures and recovery scenarios
- **[Monolithic Architecture Constraints](monolithic-architecture-constraints.md):** Complex system architectures that make clean rollbacks technically challenging
- **[Quality Blind Spots](quality-blind-spots.md):** Inadequate testing of rollback procedures before they're needed
- **[Planning Dysfunction](planning-dysfunction.md):** Assumption that deployments will always succeed or be easily fixable
- **[Poor Operational Concept](poor-operational-concept.md):** Lack of operational planning for deployment failure scenarios
- **[Tool Limitations](tool-limitations.md):** Deployment tools that don't support proper rollback mechanisms
- **[Legacy Configuration Management Chaos](legacy-configuration-management-chaos.md):** Configuration complexity that prevents clean rollbacks
- **[Short-Term Focus](short-term-focus.md):** Focus on forward deployment without considering rollback requirements
- **[Cross-System Data Synchronization Problems](cross-system-data-synchronization-problems.md):** Data synchronization challenges that complicate rollback procedures
- **[Manual Deployment Processes](manual-deployment-processes.md):** Manual deployment approaches that don't plan for automated rollback
- **[High Technical Debt](high-technical-debt.md):** Technical debt that makes rollback implementation complex and risky

## Detection Methods ○

- Review deployment documentation for rollback procedure coverage
- Audit database migration scripts for presence of rollback/down migrations
- Test rollback procedures in staging environments as part of deployment planning
- Assess infrastructure provisioning tools for state management and rollback capabilities
- Survey deployment teams about confidence in rollback options
- Review incident response procedures for rollback vs. fix-forward decision trees
- Examine deployment tooling for built-in rollback functionality
- Analyze historical incident data for cases where rollback would have reduced impact

## Examples

An e-commerce platform deploys a new payment processing feature during a routine Friday evening release. The deployment includes database schema changes that add new columns and modify existing constraints. Two hours after deployment, customer reports start flooding in about failed payment processing that's blocking orders. The team discovers a critical bug in the new payment logic that affects all transactions. However, they realize they cannot roll back because the database migrations are irreversible - they added required columns that can't be safely removed without data loss. The team is forced to spend the entire weekend debugging and fixing the payment issue in production while the e-commerce site loses revenue from failed transactions. A proper rollback strategy with reversible database changes could have restored service within minutes instead of days.
