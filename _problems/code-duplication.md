## Description

Code duplication occurs when similar or identical functionality is implemented in multiple places throughout a codebase. While some duplication might be intentional or harmless, excessive duplication creates maintenance nightmares as bugs must be fixed in multiple locations, features must be updated in several places, and inconsistencies inevitably emerge as different copies evolve independently. This problem is particularly common in legacy systems where different developers have solved similar problems in isolation.

## Indicators ⟡
- Similar logic appears in multiple files or functions
- Bug fixes need to be applied in several different locations
- Features are inconsistently implemented across different parts of the system
- Copy-paste patterns are evident in code history or structure
- Developers frequently ask "where else do I need to make this change?"

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Inconsistent Behavior](inconsistent-behavior.md):** Similar functionality behaves differently in different parts of the system
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Bug fixes and feature updates require changes in multiple locations
- **[Inconsistent Codebase](inconsistent-codebase.md):** Different implementations of the same logic lead to varying code styles and approaches
- **[Synchronization Problems](synchronization-problems.md):** Updates to one copy of the logic don't get applied to other copies, causing divergent behavior
- **Increased Bug Risk:** Fixing a bug in one location while missing other locations introduces inconsistent system behavior

## Root Causes ▼
- **[Copy-Paste Programming](copy-paste-programming.md):** Developers duplicate existing code rather than creating reusable components
- **Lack of Abstraction:** No effort to identify and extract common patterns into shared utilities or libraries
- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** Pressure to deliver quickly leads to shortcuts where duplication seems faster than proper abstraction
- **Poor Code Organization:** Existing reusable code is hard to find or poorly documented, encouraging duplication
- **[Team Silos](team-silos.md):** Different teams or developers work in isolation and unknowingly solve the same problems
- **[Review Process Breakdown](review-process-breakdown.md):** Inadequate review processes fail to catch duplication before it's introduced
- **Legacy System Evolution:** Over time, different solutions to similar problems accumulate without refactoring

## Detection Methods ○
- **Static Analysis Tools:** Use tools that can identify duplicate or similar code blocks across the codebase
- **Copy-Paste Detection:** Tools like CPD (Copy-Paste Detector) can find duplicated code segments
- **Code Review Patterns:** Watch for reviewers asking "isn't this similar to code in module X?"
- **Similarity Analysis:** Measure code similarity between modules to identify potential duplication
- **Bug Pattern Analysis:** Track bugs that need to be fixed in multiple locations as indicators of duplication

## Examples

An e-commerce system has three different user input validation routines: one for user registration, one for profile updates, and one for checkout forms. Each validates email addresses differently—the registration form accepts international domains, the profile update rejects certain special characters that registration allows, and the checkout form has its own set of rules. When a security vulnerability is discovered in email validation, the fix must be applied in three different places, but the developer only fixes two of them. This leads to inconsistent user experience and a security hole that persists in the checkout process. In another case, a financial application has identical currency formatting code copied across twelve different reporting modules. When the business requirements change to support a new currency format, developers must hunt down all twelve instances and hope they don't miss any, leading to reports that display currency inconsistently.
