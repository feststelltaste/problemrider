## Description

Extended cycle times occur when the total time from work initiation to completion is significantly longer than the actual time spent working on the task. This indicates that work spends more time waiting in queues, blocked by dependencies, or stalled in processes than being actively worked on. Extended cycle times reduce responsiveness to business needs and indicate inefficiencies in the development process.

## Indicators ⟡

- Total time from task start to completion is many times longer than actual work time
- Work items spend more time "in progress" than being actively worked on
- Tasks remain in the same status for extended periods without progress
- Small changes take weeks or months to complete despite requiring hours of work
- Team can identify significant waiting periods in their work process

## Symptoms ▲

- **Slow Response to Business needs:** Long cycle times prevent quick response to changing requirements
- **Reduced Agility:** Organization cannot adapt quickly due to long development cycles
- **[Stakeholder Frustration](stakeholder-frustration.md):** Business stakeholders become frustrated with slow delivery
- **Planning Difficulties:** Long, unpredictable cycle times make planning challenging
- **[Competitive Disadvantage](competitive-disadvantage.md):** Slow delivery puts organization at disadvantage versus competitors

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Work Queue Buildup](work-queue-buildup.md):** Tasks spend excessive time waiting in queues
- **[Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md):** Process constraints limit overall flow
- **[Approval Dependencies](approval-dependencies.md):** Work is delayed waiting for approvals
- **[Context Switching Overhead](context-switching-overhead.md):** Team members switch between tasks, extending individual task completion times
- **[Process Design Flaws](process-design-flaws.md):** Poorly designed processes create unnecessary delays

## Detection Methods ○

- **Cycle Time Measurement:** Track total time from work start to completion
- **Flow Efficiency Analysis:** Calculate ratio of work time to total cycle time
- **Wait Time Tracking:** Identify how much time tasks spend waiting versus being worked on
- **Process Step Analysis:** Measure time spent at each stage of the development process
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare cycle times for similar work items to identify patterns

## Examples

A simple bug fix that requires 2 hours of development time takes 6 weeks to reach production due to extended code review queues, deployment approval processes, and monthly release cycles. The actual work is completed quickly, but the fix spends most of its time waiting in various queues and approval processes. Another example involves a feature request that takes 3 months from approval to delivery, despite only requiring 1 week of actual development work. The extended cycle time is caused by waiting for design approval, development queue backlogs, testing bottlenecks, and deployment scheduling constraints.
