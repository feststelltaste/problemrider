## Description

Process design flaws occur when development processes are structured in ways that create unnecessary steps, bottlenecks, redundancies, or obstacles to efficient work completion. These flaws often arise from processes that evolved organically without systematic design, were copied from inappropriate contexts, or haven't been updated to reflect current needs and constraints. Poor process design wastes time and creates frustration for team members.

## Indicators ⟡

- Processes have unnecessary steps that don't add value
- Same information or approvals are required multiple times
- Process steps are in illogical order creating rework or waiting
- Processes require more time and effort than the work they're supposed to support
- Team members frequently work around official processes

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Inefficient Processes](inefficient-processes.md):** Processes take longer and require more effort than necessary
- **[Bottleneck Formation](bottleneck-formation.md):** Process design creates constraints that limit overall throughput
- **Process Circumvention:** Team members bypass official processes to get work done
- **Administrative Overhead:** Excessive time spent on process compliance rather than productive work
- **Delayed Work Completion:** Process requirements slow down task completion unnecessarily

## Root Causes ▼

- **Organic Process Evolution:** Processes evolved without systematic design or optimization
- **Copy-Paste Process Design:** Processes copied from inappropriate contexts without adaptation
- **Compliance-First Design:** Processes designed to meet compliance requirements without considering efficiency
- **Lack of Process Expertise:** Team lacks experience in designing efficient processes
- **[Resistance to Change](resistance-to-change.md):** Existing processes aren't updated despite changing needs

## Detection Methods ○

- **Process Mapping:** Document actual process steps and identify inefficiencies or redundancies
- **Value Stream Analysis:** Identify which process steps add value versus which create waste
- **Process Timing:** Measure how long each process step takes and identify bottlenecks
- **User Experience Assessment:** Collect feedback from people who use the processes
- **Process Compliance Tracking:** Monitor how often people work around official processes

## Examples

A software development team's deployment process requires code to be reviewed by three different people in sequence, even for minor bug fixes. Each reviewer must approve the change before it can move to the next reviewer, creating a serial bottleneck where a simple one-line fix can take a week to deploy. The process was designed during a compliance audit and hasn't been updated to reflect the team's actual risk tolerance or the different types of changes they deploy. Another example involves a feature request process where developers must fill out a detailed technical specification document before they can start any work, even for small changes that could be completed in an hour. The specification process often takes longer than the actual implementation, causing developers to either avoid small improvements or work around the process entirely.
