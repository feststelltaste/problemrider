## Description

Competing priorities occur when multiple projects, initiatives, or tasks are all labeled as urgent or critical, forcing teams to divide their attention and resources between conflicting demands. This creates a situation where no single priority receives adequate focus, leading to suboptimal outcomes across all initiatives. Teams become stretched thin, context switching increases, and the organization fails to make meaningful progress on any priority.

## Indicators ⟡

- Multiple projects are simultaneously labeled as "top priority" or "critical"
- Team members are assigned to several high-priority initiatives simultaneously
- Resources must be shared across competing urgent projects
- Deadlines for different priorities conflict with each other
- Management cannot clearly articulate which priority should take precedence

## Symptoms ▲

- **Context Switch Overhead:** Team efficiency decreases due to frequent task switching
- **[Project Resource Constraints](project-resource-constraints.md):** No single project gets sufficient resources to succeed
- **[Delayed Project Timelines](delayed-project-timelines.md):** All projects suffer delays due to divided attention
- **[Developer Frustration and Burnout](developer-frustration-and-burnout.md):** Team members feel overwhelmed by competing demands
- **[Lower Code Quality](lower-code-quality.md):** Quality suffers when attention is divided across multiple priorities

## Root Causes ▼

- **Unclear Strategic Vision:** Organization lacks clear direction about what's most important
- **Opportunistic Decision Making:** New priorities are added without considering existing commitments
- **Resource Scarcity:** Limited resources force competition between legitimate needs
- **Political Pressure:** Different stakeholders push for their priorities to be considered most important
- **Fear of Missing Opportunities:** Organization tries to pursue too many opportunities simultaneously

## Detection Methods ○

- **Priority Count Analysis:** Track how many initiatives are labeled as top priority simultaneously
- **Resource Allocation Mapping:** Visualize how resources are divided across competing priorities
- **Team Assignment Overlap:** Measure how many high-priority projects team members are assigned to
- **Context Switch Frequency:** Monitor how often team members switch between different priorities
- **Stakeholder Priority Surveys:** Compare different stakeholders' understanding of organizational priorities

## Examples

A development team is simultaneously assigned to three "critical" projects: modernizing the authentication system (due to security vulnerabilities), implementing a new customer portal (promised to key clients), and upgrading the payment processing system (required for regulatory compliance). Each project has different stakeholders who consider their project the most important, and each has urgent deadlines. The team spends Monday working on authentication, Tuesday on the customer portal, and Wednesday on payment processing, losing significant time to context switching and never gaining enough momentum on any single project to make meaningful progress. All three projects end up delayed, and the quality suffers because the team cannot focus deeply on solving complex problems. Another example involves a startup where the CEO declares that user acquisition, product development, and technical infrastructure are all equally critical priorities. The small development team tries to balance building new features, fixing technical debt, and implementing growth experiments, but the constant priority shifting means they make minimal progress on any area. The product becomes increasingly buggy, user acquisition stalls due to poor user experience, and infrastructure problems worsen because they're never addressed comprehensively.
