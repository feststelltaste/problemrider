## Description

Duplicated work occurs when multiple team members independently work on the same tasks, solve the same problems, or implement similar solutions without being aware of each other's efforts. This duplication wastes development resources, can create conflicting implementations, and indicates problems with team coordination and communication. The problem is particularly costly in large teams or distributed development environments.

## Indicators ⟡

- Multiple team members independently implement similar functionality
- Same problems are researched or solved by different people
- Conflicting solutions are developed for the same requirements
- Team members discover others were working on their assigned tasks
- Code reviews reveal multiple implementations of the same logic

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Wasted Development Effort](wasted-development-effort.md):** Resources are spent on redundant work that doesn't add value
- **Conflicting Implementations:** Multiple solutions for the same problem must be reconciled
- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** Duplicate implementations create integration challenges
- **[Team Coordination Issues](team-coordination-issues.md):** Poor coordination allows duplicate work to occur
- **[Reduced Team Productivity](reduced-team-productivity.md):** Overall team productivity decreases due to redundant efforts

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Team Confusion](team-confusion.md):** Team members are unclear about who is responsible for what work
- **[Communication Breakdown](communication-breakdown.md):** Team members don't effectively communicate about their work assignments
- **Inadequate Work Tracking:** No system to track who is working on what tasks
- **Task Assignment Overlap:** Multiple people are assigned to overlapping or identical tasks
- **Siloed Development:** Team members work in isolation without awareness of others' work

## Detection Methods ○

- **Work Assignment Tracking:** Monitor task assignments to identify potential overlaps
- **Code Analysis:** Analyze codebase for duplicate or similar implementations
- **Retrospective Discussions:** Regular team discussions to identify instances of duplicated effort
- **Communication Pattern Analysis:** Assess whether team members effectively share information about their work
- **Task Completion Review:** Review completed work to identify instances where multiple people solved the same problems

## Examples

Two developers in different time zones both spend a week implementing user authentication functionality because task assignments weren't clearly communicated and neither was aware the other was working on it. When they attempt to merge their code, they discover they've built incompatible solutions that require significant additional work to reconcile. Another example involves a team where three different developers independently research and implement solutions for handling file uploads, each spending days on research and implementation that could have been shared across the team if communication had been better.
