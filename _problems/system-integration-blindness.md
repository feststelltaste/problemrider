## Description

System integration blindness occurs when teams lack visibility into how individual components behave when integrated as a complete system. While individual services, modules, or components may function correctly in isolation, their interactions, data flows, and dependencies create emergent behaviors that are difficult to predict or test. This blindness to system-level integration issues leads to failures that only manifest when components are combined, often during deployment or under real-world usage conditions.

## Indicators ⟡

- Integration issues consistently surface during deployment rather than during development
- Components that pass individual testing fail when deployed together
- Data inconsistencies appear across system boundaries
- Performance degrades significantly when systems are integrated
- Debugging requires extensive investigation across multiple components

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** Combining separately developed components requires significant troubleshooting
- **[System Outages](system-outages.md):** System-wide failures occur due to interaction problems between components
- **[Hidden Dependencies](hidden-dependencies.md):** Unknown interdependencies cause cascading failures
- **[Cross-System Data Synchronization Problems](cross-system-data-synchronization-problems.md):** Data becomes inconsistent across system boundaries
- **[Deployment Coupling](deployment-coupling.md):** Changes to one component unexpectedly affect others
- **[Cascade Failures](cascade-failures.md):** Problems in one component trigger failures throughout the system

## Root Causes ▼

- **Component-Focused Testing:** Testing strategy emphasizes individual components over system integration
- **Environment Fragmentation:** Integration testing occurs in environments that don't match production complexity
- **Dependency Complexity:** Systems have implicit dependencies that aren't documented or tested
- **Async Processing Issues:** Asynchronous communication and eventual consistency create timing-dependent behaviors
- **Cross-Team Coordination Gaps:** Different teams develop components without sufficient integration planning
- **Contract Testing Gaps:** API contracts are defined but integration behavior isn't verified end-to-end

## Detection Methods ○

- **End-to-End User Journey Testing:** Verify complete workflows across all system components
- **Integration Environment Monitoring:** Track how components behave when deployed together
- **Dependency Mapping:** Document and test all system interdependencies
- **Contract Testing Implementation:** Verify that API contracts work correctly in integrated scenarios
- **Production-Like Testing:** Use environments that mirror production complexity for integration testing
- **Cross-Component Tracing:** Implement distributed tracing to understand system-level behavior

## Examples

A microservices-based ordering system has individual services (inventory, payment, shipping) that all pass their unit and integration tests. However, when deployed together, race conditions occur during high-volume periods where inventory is decremented after payment processing begins, leading to customers being charged for out-of-stock items. The issue only manifests under realistic load with multiple concurrent transactions. Another example involves a healthcare platform where patient data synchronization works perfectly in testing environments with simple data, but fails in production when dealing with complex patient records that reference multiple external systems, causing data integrity issues that affect patient care coordination.
