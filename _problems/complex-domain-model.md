## Description

A complex domain model occurs when the business domain that the software system needs to represent contains intricate rules, relationships, and concepts that are difficult to understand and implement correctly. This complexity can arise from regulatory requirements, legacy business processes, or naturally complex problem domains such as financial trading, healthcare, or scientific computing. The challenge is not just technical but also involves understanding and accurately representing complex business logic in code.

## Indicators ⟡

- Business experts struggle to explain domain rules clearly to developers
- Requirements documents are lengthy and contain numerous special cases and exceptions
- System behavior varies significantly based on context, time, or regulatory changes
- Multiple stakeholders have different interpretations of the same business rules
- Domain concepts require extensive background knowledge to understand

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Slow Knowledge Transfer](slow-knowledge-transfer.md):** New team members take exceptionally long to understand the business domain
- **[Difficult Code Comprehension](difficult-code-comprehension.md):** Even well-written code is hard to understand due to complex business logic
- **[High Bug Introduction Rate](high-bug-introduction-rate.md):** Developers misunderstand business rules and implement incorrect logic
- **[Inadequate Test Data Management](inadequate-test-data-management.md):** Creating realistic test scenarios is difficult due to domain complexity
- **[Extended Research Time](extended-research-time.md):** Developers need significant time to research and understand domain concepts before implementing features

## Root Causes ▼

- **Regulatory Complexity:** Industries with heavy regulation create naturally complex business rules
- **Legacy Business Processes:** Years of accumulated business logic and special cases create complexity
- **Domain Evolution:** Business domains that have evolved over time accumulate complexity and inconsistencies
- **Multiple Stakeholder Perspectives:** Different business units have different interpretations of the same domain concepts
- **Implicit Business Knowledge:** Much of the domain knowledge exists as unwritten tribal knowledge

## Detection Methods ○

- **Domain Complexity Analysis:** Evaluate the number of business rules, exceptions, and special cases in requirements
- **Stakeholder Interview Consistency:** Measure how consistently different stakeholders explain the same domain concepts
- **Implementation Time Tracking:** Monitor how long it takes to implement features relative to their apparent simplicity
- **Bug Pattern Analysis:** Analyze whether bugs are typically related to business logic misunderstanding
- **Documentation Volume:** Assess the amount of documentation required to explain domain concepts

## Examples

A healthcare insurance system must handle hundreds of different plan types, each with unique coverage rules, deductible structures, co-payment requirements, and network restrictions. The system must also comply with state and federal regulations that vary by geography and change frequently. A simple claim processing request involves checking member eligibility, plan coverage, provider network status, prior authorization requirements, coordination of benefits with other insurers, and applying various cost-sharing rules. The business rules are so complex that even insurance experts disagree on edge cases, and implementing a new plan type requires weeks of analysis to understand all the interactions. Another example is a commodities trading system where pricing depends on delivery location, contract type, seasonal factors, storage costs, currency fluctuations, and regulatory requirements that vary by jurisdiction. The domain knowledge required to understand why a particular pricing algorithm works requires expertise in both financial markets and the specific commodity being traded.
