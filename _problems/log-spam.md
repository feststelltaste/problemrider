## Description
Log spam is the excessive generation of log messages. This can be a major problem for a number of reasons. First, it can make it difficult to find important information in the logs. Second, it can consume a lot of disk space. Third, it can have a negative impact on the performance of the application. Log spam is often a symptom of a deeper problem, such as the N+1 query problem or a lack of proper logging configuration.

## Indicators ⟡
- The logs are growing at a rapid rate.
- The logs are full of repetitive messages.
- It is difficult to find important information in the logs.
- The application is slow, and you suspect that logging may be a contributing factor.

## Symptoms ▲
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** It is difficult to debug problems because the logs are full of noise.
- **[Increased Cost of Development](increased-cost-of-development.md):** The high volume of logs may require more disk space and more powerful logging infrastructure.
- **[Slow Application Performance](slow-application-performance.md):** The overhead of logging can have a negative impact on the performance of the application.
- **[Unpredictable System Behavior](unpredictable-system-behavior.md):** Important alerts may be missed because they are buried in a sea of log spam.

## Root Causes ▼
- **[N+1 Query Problem](n-plus-one-query-problem.md):** The N+1 query problem can generate a lot of log spam, as each query is logged individually.
- **[Excessive Logging](excessive-logging.md):** The application may be configured to log too much information.
- **Lack of a Logging Strategy:** The team does not have a clear plan for what to log and how to log it.
- **Lack of a Log Management Solution:** The team is not using a log management solution to collect, store, and analyze their logs.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Third-party libraries may be generating a lot of log spam.

## Detection Methods ○
- **Log Analysis:** Analyze your logs to identify patterns and trends.
- **Log Volume Monitoring:** Monitor the volume of your logs over time.
- **Code Review:** During code reviews, specifically look for code that is generating a lot of log messages.
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** APM tools can often detect and flag log spam.

## Examples
A web application is using a third-party library that is generating a lot of log spam. The logs are growing at a rapid rate, and it is difficult to find important information in them. The team is not aware of the problem because they are not monitoring their logs. One day, the application goes down, and the team is not able to figure out why because the logs are full of noise. The problem could have been avoided if the team had been monitoring their logs and had taken action to address the log spam.
