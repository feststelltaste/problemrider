## Description

Bottleneck formation occurs when specific individuals, processes, or system components become limiting factors that constrain the overall throughput and efficiency of development work. These bottlenecks create queues, delays, and dependencies that slow down the entire team's progress. Bottlenecks can form around people with specialized knowledge, approval processes, shared resources, or technical constraints.

## Indicators ⟡

- Work consistently backs up waiting for specific individuals or processes
- Team velocity is limited by the capacity of particular team members
- Certain processes take disproportionately long compared to surrounding activities
- Work flow is irregular with periods of waiting followed by periods of rush
- Team productivity varies significantly based on bottleneck availability

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Review Bottlenecks](review-bottlenecks.md):** Code review processes become significant constraints on development flow
- **[Slow Development Velocity](slow-development-velocity.md):** Overall team progress is limited by bottleneck capacity
- **[Work Queue Buildup](work-queue-buildup.md):** Tasks accumulate waiting for bottleneck resources
- **[Context Switching Overhead](context-switching-overhead.md):** Team members switch between tasks while waiting for bottlenecks
- **[Uneven Work Flow](uneven-work-flow.md):** Work progresses in fits and starts rather than smoothly

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Critical knowledge concentrated in specific individuals creates people bottlenecks
- **[Process Design Flaws](process-design-flaws.md):** Inefficient processes that haven't been optimized for throughput
- **Resource Constraints:** Insufficient capacity in critical areas
- **[Approval Dependencies](approval-dependencies.md):** Too many decision points requiring specific individuals
- **[Technical Architecture Limitations](technical-architecture-limitations.md):** System design creates performance or access bottlenecks
- **[Capacity Mismatch](capacity-mismatch.md):** Available capacity doesn't match demand patterns creating constraints

## Detection Methods ○

- **Flow Analysis:** Track work items through the development process to identify where delays occur
- **Capacity Utilization Monitoring:** Measure utilization rates across different team members and processes
- **Queue Length Tracking:** Monitor how work accumulates in different stages of the development pipeline
- **Cycle Time Measurement:** Analyze how long work items take to complete and where time is spent
- **Dependency Mapping:** Identify critical dependencies that create constraints on work flow

## Examples

A development team's progress is consistently limited by their senior architect who must review and approve all significant design decisions. Work backs up waiting for her availability, and team members often wait days for design guidance before they can proceed with implementation. Despite having six developers, the team's effective throughput is constrained by one person's capacity for design reviews and architectural decisions. Another example involves a deployment process that requires manual approval from the operations team and can only be performed during specific maintenance windows. Development work gets completed quickly, but features sit waiting for deployment slots, creating a significant bottleneck between development completion and value delivery. The team realizes that their deployment bottleneck is limiting their ability to deliver value to customers efficiently.
