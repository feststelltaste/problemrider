## Description

Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to overwrite adjacent memory locations. This can corrupt data, crash the application, or be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code. Buffer overflows are particularly dangerous because they can be used to compromise system security by overwriting return addresses, function pointers, or other critical program data.

## Indicators ⟡

- Application crashes with segmentation faults or access violations
- Memory corruption symptoms such as unexpected variable values
- Security scanning tools report potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Crashes occur when processing specific input patterns or sizes
- Stack traces show corruption or unexpected function call sequences

## Symptoms ▲

- **Application Crashes:** Segmentation faults, access violations, or other memory-related crashes
- **[Unpredictable System Behavior](unpredictable-system-behavior.md):** Memory corruption causes erratic program behavior
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Potential for code injection and privilege escalation attacks
- **Data Corruption:** Adjacent memory structures become corrupted by buffer overruns
- **[Data Protection Risk](data-protection-risk.md):** Sensitive information may be exposed or compromised

## Root Causes ▼

- **Unsafe String Operations:** Use of functions like strcpy, strcat, or sprintf without bounds checking
- **Array Bounds Violations:** Accessing array elements beyond allocated boundaries
- **Input Validation Failures:** Insufficient validation of input data size before copying to buffers
- **Off-by-One Errors:** Incorrect loop bounds or size calculations that exceed buffer limits
- **Stack Buffer Overflows:** Local array overflows that overwrite stack return addresses
- **Heap Buffer Overflows:** Dynamic memory buffer overflows that corrupt heap metadata

## Detection Methods ○

- **Static Analysis Tools:** Use tools that can identify potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities in source code
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Runtime tools like AddressSanitizer that detect buffer overflows during execution
- **Fuzzing:** Automated testing with random or malformed inputs to trigger buffer overflow conditions
- **Code Review:** Manual review focusing on memory management and bounds checking
- **Penetration Testing:** Security testing specifically targeting buffer overflow exploitation
- **Memory Protection Tools:** Use tools like Valgrind to detect memory errors during development

## Examples

A C program uses the strcpy function to copy user input into a fixed-size character array without checking the input length. When a user provides input longer than the buffer size, strcpy overwrites adjacent stack memory, potentially corrupting local variables or the function return address. An attacker can exploit this by crafting input that overwrites the return address with the address of malicious code, effectively hijacking program execution. Another example involves a network service that reads packet data into a fixed buffer without validating the packet size field. Malicious packets with incorrect size information can cause the service to write beyond buffer boundaries, potentially allowing remote code execution or causing service crashes that enable denial-of-service attacks.
