## Description

Shadow systems are informal, unofficial applications, tools, or processes that teams create to work around limitations in official systems. While often born from legitimate needs and good intentions, these systems operate outside of organizational oversight, lack proper documentation, security controls, and maintenance procedures. They create hidden dependencies, compliance risks, and potential points of failure that the organization is not prepared to handle.

## Indicators ⟡

- Teams use homegrown tools or spreadsheets instead of official enterprise systems
- Data is maintained in multiple places with manual synchronization
- Business processes depend on individual-maintained applications or scripts
- IT department is unaware of critical business tools being used by teams
- Official reports don't match what teams are actually using for decision-making

## Symptoms ▲

- **Data Inconsistency:** Information differs between official and shadow systems
- **[Single Points of Failure](single-points-of-failure.md):** Business processes depend on unofficial systems without backup plans
- **Compliance Risks:** Shadow systems may not meet regulatory or security requirements
- **[Integration Difficulties](integration-difficulties.md):** Official systems can't integrate with unknown shadow solutions
- **[Hidden Dependencies](hidden-dependencies.md):** Business operations unknowingly depend on unmaintained systems

## Root Causes ▼

- **Inadequate Official Systems:** Enterprise systems don't meet actual business needs
- **Slow IT Response:** IT department takes too long to address legitimate business requirements
- **Bureaucratic Processes:** Official channels for system changes are too complex or slow
- **Resource Constraints:** IT lacks resources to provide needed solutions
- **User Empowerment Culture:** Organization encourages teams to solve problems independently

## Detection Methods ○

- **System Discovery Audits:** Regular surveys to identify unofficial tools and systems
- **Data Flow Analysis:** Map where business data actually flows versus official channels
- **Access Log Review:** Analyze what systems and tools employees actually use
- **Business Process Interviews:** Interview teams about their actual work processes
- **Security Vulnerability Assessments:** Scan for unauthorized applications and data stores

## Examples

A sales team creates an elaborate Excel spreadsheet with macros to track leads because the official CRM system is too slow and missing key fields they need. The spreadsheet becomes the primary source of truth for sales forecasting, but it's maintained by one person who hasn't documented how it works. When that person goes on vacation, the sales team can't update forecasts, and management makes decisions based on outdated information. The spreadsheet also contains customer data that isn't backed up or secured according to company policies. Another example involves a development team that builds a custom dashboard to monitor application performance because the official monitoring tools don't provide the specific metrics they need. The dashboard becomes critical for incident response, but it runs on a developer's personal cloud account and uses API keys that expire without notice. When the system fails during a production outage, the team loses visibility into system health just when they need it most.
