## Description

Poor documentation occurs when the written information about a system, its architecture, business rules, APIs, deployment procedures, and operational requirements is inadequate for developers to understand and work with the system effectively. This includes documentation that is outdated, incomplete, inaccurate, poorly organized, or simply non-existent. Poor documentation forces developers to rely on tribal knowledge and experimentation, slowing development and increasing the risk of errors.

## Indicators ⟡

- Documentation hasn't been updated in months or years despite system changes
- Developers rarely consult existing documentation because it's known to be unreliable
- New team members cannot get started without extensive one-on-one guidance
- API documentation doesn't match actual API behavior
- Deployment and operational procedures exist only as tribal knowledge

## Symptoms ▲

- **[Slow Knowledge Transfer](slow-knowledge-transfer.md):** New team members take excessive time to become productive
- **[Knowledge Silos](knowledge-silos.md):** Information remains trapped in the minds of specific individuals
- **[Extended Research Time](extended-research-time.md):** Developers spend excessive time figuring out how existing systems work
- **[Inconsistent Execution](inconsistent-execution.md):** Different team members handle similar tasks differently due to lack of standard procedures
- **[Debugging Difficulties](debugging-difficulties.md):** Problems are harder to diagnose without proper system documentation

## Root Causes ▼

- **[Time Pressure](time-pressure.md):** No time allocated for creating and maintaining documentation
- **Lack of Documentation Culture:** Team culture doesn't value or prioritize documentation
- **[Tool Limitations](tool-limitations.md):** Inadequate tools make documentation creation and maintenance difficult
- **[Rapid System Changes](rapid-system-changes.md):** Documentation becomes outdated quickly due to frequent system modifications
- **[Unclear Documentation Ownership](unclear-documentation-ownership.md):** No clear responsibility for maintaining documentation

## Detection Methods ○

- **Documentation Currency Analysis:** Compare documentation dates with recent system changes
- **Documentation Usage Tracking:** Monitor how often team members actually use existing documentation
- **Documentation Gap Assessment:** Identify areas where documentation is missing or inadequate
- **New Hire Documentation Feedback:** Collect feedback from new team members about documentation effectiveness
- **Documentation Accuracy Audit:** Verify that existing documentation matches actual system behavior

## Examples

A microservices architecture has 47 different services, but only 12 have any API documentation, and most of that documentation was last updated 18 months ago. New developers trying to understand service interactions must reverse-engineer API contracts by reading code and testing endpoints manually. The deployment documentation references servers that were decommissioned two years ago, and the actual deployment process involves a series of manual steps that exist only in the memory of two senior developers. When those developers go on vacation, deployments either stop completely or fail because no one else knows the complete process. Another example involves a financial trading system where the business rules documentation was written during the initial implementation five years ago but hasn't been updated despite dozens of regulatory changes and business requirement modifications. Developers implementing new features must interview business analysts and examine legacy code to understand current requirements, often discovering undocumented exceptions and special cases that cause bugs in production.
